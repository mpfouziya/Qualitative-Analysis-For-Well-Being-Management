      "[' We have 26 to 27 anganwadis from one corner to another corner.', 'That means there is one anganwadi for every 200 houses? Yes.', 'That means there are 26000 people here. Yes. That much is for sure, from one corner to another corner there are that much.', 'That means this is a huge community. There is a lot in the interiors. How much ever population is there in the interior, that much is there in the exterior also.', 'When we come from Gandhi Ashram, we have seen some near the bridge and here. There is still a lot in the interiors. Till Ranip Crossing there is lot of them.', 'That means it covers the entire Vadaj Village and also the other side of Kitli ? No, that area is not included. It is there, but it is a different ward. For us it is from Juna Vadej to Ranip Crossroad. And in that entire belt we have our anganwadis.', 'Oh, that means lot of population is there. Yes, there is lot of population.', 'How many kids come here generally? What is your schedule for the whole day and what is your work? At morning when we come, kids of 3 to 6 years come to our anganwadi. First, we have to give Shira and Rab to 6 months to 3-year-old kids. So, we cook Shira and Rab and make them eat. After that kids of 3 to 6 years old come to our anganwadi. We make them do prayers. Then we have to give them breakfast of Matru Mandal. On Monday and Thursday we have fruits along with snacks. We have menu of Matru Mandal from Monday to Saturday, so we have to give breakfast as per that. So after giving breakfast, a timetable is given to us for different activities from Monday to Saturday and as per that we make the children do those activities.', 'How many kids are coming? In my anganwadi regularly 35 kids are sitting.', 'Do you talk to their parents? I talk to their parents every day because our timings are from 9.30 to 3.30. Here kids come by 10.30. They sit here from 10.30 to 2.00. After we leave the kids, we have to visit 5 houses. So we have this field visit in these areas. For us, we have to cover area of around 1000 people. So by this way we definitely talk and keep in touch with them.', 'That means you have to visit 5 houses every day? What do you talk to them? If some kids are coming to our grades and is malnutritional, then we meet their mothers and   explain to her how to increase the kid’s weight and what care should be taken, also about the medical checkup. We meet ladies who are pregnant. Also we meet ladies who are newly delivered. Like that we have to do five meetings every day. Then if somebody is sick or something comes wrong with somebody, then we do the treatment. Till they don’t become alright it is our responsibility.', 'You said that there are malnutritional kids. How many are there? Around 28 definitely.', 'Out of 35, 28 are malnutritional. No, not like that. 35 kids are there in my register, but from the age of 0 to 6 years there are around 100 kids.', 'Out of that 28 are malnutritional? Yes, 28 kids are malnutritional. 6 kids are more malnutritional.', 'Is it then 28 + 6. Yes.', 'What is the reason for that? The problem here is mothers don’t have time to take care of kids. So what they do is they give one rupee in hands of kids, because they want to go out for work or do household work. So what they do is they give one rupee to kids and kids buy those one rupee packet of Mamri and Bhungla and eat it. They are very dangerous and the colors used in that are very harmful. Because of that the kids do not get nutrition. Also they eat pepsi, etc. Mothers don’t have time to cook food and feed them. Because of that kids remain malnutritional. They have lot of superstitions like if a child fall sick, they would go to the Bhuva and do Dhora Dhaga, and will not take them to dispensary. Therefore this malnutriotion is seen at high rate in the kids. Because of anganwadi there has come lot of difference. They have came out little from these superstitions and understood that if a child fall sick or if we fall sick, we should take them to dispensary. When we say them, they become immediately ready.', 'Do they listen to whatever you say? Yes, they listen.', 'Is there any time that they refused? No, it has never happened till now. But they say that I will not go alone and we also need to go with them. Then we go along with them and get the work done.', 'Where do you stay? I stay at Nava Vadaj, Bhavsar society.', 'Bhavsar means does Nithin Bhai also stays there? Is it Nithin Bhai Bhavsar?', 'No, the Nithin Bhai whom we met just now. I don’t know where he stays.', 'Nithin Bhai told that he stays near some Bhavsar hostel. That must be quiet ahead. We have Bhavsar society here.', 'Is it as free service or is it a paid job ? We are on honorary salary.', 'What is that? It is pre-decided and we get from there.', 'Is it paid by government? Yes it is paid by government.', 'Are you getting it regularly? Yes, we are getting it regularly. Sometimes it gets delayed by 10 days or so. But they give salary properly.', 'Generally in one house how many people stay? Generally five people will be definitely there.', 'Five people? Yes, minimum five people.', 'And maximum how many people stay? Maximum 10 to 15 also would be there.', 'Who all would be there? Mother-in-law, father-in-law, sons , daughter-in-laws, their kids and co sisters. Like that they stay. In many houses there are 20 people also stay.', 'In one house approximately there are how many kids? In one house around 4 to 5 kids will be there.', 'Do they have financial problem ? Yes, they have lot of financial problems. How they work is like in morning they go for work and the money they bring in the evening is used and finished for that day itself.', 'How much do they earn in a day? 150 to 200 per day they bring.', 'Both of them bring that much money? No, both bring different. Sometimes ladies may or may not be allowed to work.', 'They are not allowed also? Yes. If she go out and something goes wrong, because of that fear they don’t send. But in our side lot of ladies are going for work. They go for collecting recyclable garbage, some ladies go for job also in offices for doing jobs like cleaning tables or sweeping and cleaning floor. Even girls are going.', 'Girls are also going? Yes , girls are also going.', 'What age girls are going? Girls would be 12 to 13 years old.', 'Don’t they refuse from the house? They are in need, so what would they do. Sometimes there is no father in the house and there is no body to earn in the house. Then they would go.', 'Generally how much these gents bring and what would they do? Some of them who are earning, they waste that money by drinking alcohol.', 'All ? Yes, all. If their wives have money they beat them and take that money from her also. So the ladies don’t have any expectations like my husband would earn and take care of the children and family.', 'What is the reason for that? Here in all houses is it like that? Yes, out of 100 hardly 25. Oh, not 25 hardly 10 percent may not be drinking alcohol. Otherwise everybody drinks alcohol.', 'Is there any specific reason for that, because  once you have a house there is always the responsibility of taking care of wives, daughter, etc? Suppose you are staying  in this house and you are drinking. And you have other friends and you keep roaming with them without doing any work. And they get influenced by each other’s bad company. Then everybody starts drinking.', 'Are boys in the influence of alcohol? Hardly any boys go for studying, many boys just roam about. Lot of foul language is spoken in the house. So right from childhood kids also get influenced by this and there is 100 percent chance that they go on wrong path.', 'That means it is free here and nobody explains? No, nobody has the feeling that my son is doing something wrong and so I should correct, like how do we take care when it is our child. Now it is like go and do what you want to do. Even to their parents they speak dirty foul language which we can’t even listen to. But parents would not ask them about why you are talking this kind of language.', 'Is it because there are no feelings? I feel like that only. Our kids came into this world and now let them live their ways and we live our ways. They don’t take that kind of responsibility.', 'Even ladies have that kind of thinking? Some mothers themselves behave like that. Sometimes mothers also do like that. When the kids are roaming, sometimes we advise them to put the child for studying because the child has grown up, then they reply sharply saying let it be and he will study if he wants to, otherwise he will roam about. Even children beat their mother.', 'Is it so? Yes.', 'There is not the kind of thing like to be with each other or to take care of each other? No, not much of that kind of feeling. But when we explain to them these things, then they realize to some extent.', 'Has it improved after anganwadis started? Yes, after we came lot of changes have come. The boys were just roaming, that has reduced. They have started putting the boys into school. We made a new school here. There was one reason that they were not sending their kids before to schools since the schools were far, so parents would not find it safe to send their kids of around 7 or 8 years as they had to cross the roads. Therefore here we have Gnanshala, also there are classes going on in Manav Sadhna. So everybody started putting their kids there. But some kids themselves are not interested in studying. If one child is not studying and goes on a wrong path, then the other child also get spoiled. Sometimes that is also another reason.', 'How many percent of kids are studying, coming to school,coming to anganwadi or going to community center? 70 to 80 percent.', 'Still 20 percent, a bit spoiled public is remaining? Yes, here the center was made and it has made lot of difference. In morning lot of boys has started to coming for classes. The classes are running from first standard.', 'It is 1 to 7, right? Yes, also lots of kids are coming.', 'Do they take care of food? How many times cooking is done in a day? For these people, they have roti and Sabji only. In the morning with tea they fry roti. Who so ever wants to eat will eat , otherwise have only tea. Then the kids will have roti and Sabji and in the evening also they have roti and Sabji.', 'That means 3 times eating is done ? Yes, eating is done. But it is not like he is my son and I have to make him eat. If he wants to eat , he will eat. Otherwise it is okay. In our anganwadi there is lot of importance given to eating food. So when a child comes in the morning till 2’O clock , in morning we give Shira and Rab, then we give Matru Mandal snack. Then at around 1.30 or 2.00 we have another snack from Purak Poshan and we make that. They eat that. So then after going home a child doesn’t not eat. Then in the evening if he wants to eat he eats, otherwise he would use money to buy packet snacks from the road side shops and eat.', 'Do the kids have any addictions? No, I haven’t seen. But at the most they eat Supari.', 'Now about what age kids you are talking about? 10 or 11 years old kids, they might be eating Surily Supari which is sweet.', 'How about those who are bigger like 15, 17 or 20 years old? Do they have any bad habits? Yes, some of them have these kind of addictions like eating Gutkha.', 'If somebody falls sick in their house, do they cook separate for them? No, they just cook what they cook regularly and not cooked anything separate for them.', 'Okay, that means these people don’t have any awareness about nutritious food? Whatever they are cooking they will cook? They are not aware that if we eat a particular thing we get a particular kind of nutrient. Whatever is available they would cook. Sometimes they don’t have money for Sabji also. Then they would eat chilli and Rotlo. Or they would eat just fried roti only.', 'In what category do they mostly fall? Have you seen somebody who is fat or healthy bodied person? No, we haven’t seen such person. Everybody is medium only.', 'What kind of activities these people do right from the morning? What do you mean?', 'Suppose there is a normal family who stays here ,what work the male, ladies, children or grandparents of the house do in a full day? The ladies will do their work, those who go out for earning may or may not go. It is as per their wish. There are some who have the feeling of responsibility that she have to earn, and they go for earning. Some go for roaming and some will be just standing in groups. Sometimes when we come in the morning there will be many men standing at Galla shops.', 'Who does more work? Gents or ladies? I cannot decide. Because we see gents also and ladies also. But I feel ladies are working more.', 'In a house 5 to 6 people are staying. In that who do more work? Yes, ladies do more work. Because men don’t understand if my child or wife has fallen sick, then it is my responsibility to do help for them. But ladies feel more this way.', 'Ladies have more than them, but not up to your expectations? Yeah, but gents have very less.', 'Mother – in – law and father- in – law are staying together, so are they also not taken care of? Many people take care.', 'Do they do physical activities like exercises? No , we haven’t seen anybody doing that. Because from morning when they get up, whatever they do is like exercise only. Those who do labor work is like a physical exercise only, but those who live sedater lifestyle, they live that way only. They don’t feel like since they are free, they should do exercise or yoga.', 'So that means in a whole day the exercise is done in whatever physical labor work they do, nothing extra? Yes, that much only. Nothing extra.', 'Are there any camps done in anganwadi? Yes, lot of camps are done.', 'Have you told them that so many illnesses are going on and if you do exercises you will be better? Yes , we have made arrangements to do exercises and lot of people comes to do exercises. Lot of camps are also done for different diseases.  They come to do the checkups, but not like from diagnosis to curing it. Only some people do till curing and some people treat only if we pay attention, otherwise they will leave it.', 'So mostly everybody will leave it like that? Yes, many people will leave it. We have a TB center here. We help them for TB medicines also , but if we give them medicines at home, they may or may not take or leave half way also. Whereas TB medicines need to be taken regularly every day. So we keep medicines with us and give them as per schedule. Then only it will be done, otherwise here it is full of carelessness. They may or may not take medicines and it is over.', 'If I get sick and if I am going out then doctor will give medicines for 15 to 20 days, but if I feel alright in 7 days then I stop medicine.  Does it happen here? Yes, they also do that. When they feel good they stop medicine.', 'Don’t they have the understanding that the course need to be completed? No, they don’t understand that the course need to be completed. Some people might also say to leave the medicine and go and show it to the Bhuva. Because they believe in Bhuva also. We wanted them to do family planning operation, but then they say no and we have been given Bhadha and they refuse to do that. Some people would refuse and some people readily agree to do the family planning as well.', 'That means the superstition is still there? Yes, to some extent. When we started long back how to deal with them was a big question for us. But right now, when we say, they understand. We have done very nice drama and other programmes and make them understand this way and it has made lot of difference.', 'That means you had done lot of work? Yes. In a year as many programmes comes we do those and we do extra also. In all anganwadis very nice programmes are done.', 'Children or their parents agree to your advises? Sometimes they will and sometimes they don’t.', 'In the house itself when parents try to give advice to their children do they agree? Many agree and many don’t agree.', 'What would the most of them do? Do they agree or they don’t agree? I don’t know exactly, but many agree and many don’t agree. When mother says to not to do this, he would say “I want to do and I will do”.', 'Do house people pressurize? If they pressurize there will be fighting and arguments. Right from the morning, once they get up, you can see them fighting.', 'Is it so? Within themselves? Mother and kids like that? Yes, within themselves. Siblings and parents keeps fighting by speaking foul languages to each other. For them fighting means speaking bad languages to each other. They don’t fight normally. They speak lot of foul languages.', 'Do they do beating? Yes, they do beating also.', 'Now that you have worked here for so many years. Do you feel like if the parents change themselves or their system in a particular way, then kids would start listening to them? Yes we have realized so.', 'As per you, how  should parents change, so that kids would listen to them? For example, like how to give advice like for small kids when we tell them to don’t touch something, they would definitely touch it. So instead we should tell them you must take this, then they will not take it. So is there a way of saying something like that? If we tell children with love then they would do. So many kids are coming in our angawadi, if we disrespect them, they would become adamant. But if we keep calling them “my child” with love, then they would definitely do everything that we tell them. And here we treat them normally like we all do. But when they go home they get changed to the home atmosphere.', 'What is the reason for this kind of atmosphere in the house? Sometimes they have tensions, sometimes they don’t have money or food, sometimes problems with relatives. These could be the reasons.', 'That means kids are just hungry for love. Yes, if you tell with love, then the work will be done nicely. With Vaghri community also, we deal with love. When we talk to them with love we also get the same response.', 'Do you conduct meetings? We conduct Matha meeting every month. We call mothers of malnutritional kids and explain them how to take care of those kids like how to feed them or what to give in their food or if the child is not able to eat more at a time, then feed them every one hour, etc. Like this, first of every month we do meetings with mothers and talk to them.', 'Do they listen to your advises? Do everybody come in the meeting? Yes, they come.', 'Do you follow up? Yes, we check. If we have been given some medicines we go once in every 2 to 3 days to their house and check whether they are taking or finishing those medicines as required. Sometimes they say that this medicines is not suiting my child, then we advise them to go back to doctor and check again. So the doctor can change the medicine. So like this, when we say they do.', 'Are there any incidents occurred like you advised somebody and they haven’t listened, when you go to check you realized that the things are same as before? There are one or two houses like that, there both the kids were malnutritioned. She take medicines to their home. Her husband also take medicines to the home. But then they don’t finish it. We also do the follow up. But then they come with us, take the medicines and don’t complete them.', 'They go home and then they forget? Yes, they forget. Their kids had fell very sick recently and they admitted them in dispensary. They were given medicines from there , also I had a camp here and that time I had brought him here. So they were given medicines from here also. But they didn’t start those medicines also by saying that my doctor has given me another medicine. But I feel that they will not complete neither that nor these medicines.', 'What is reason for that? Is there any way to encourage them to do these things for themselves as they are doing it for their own good?  If they complete the medicine , it will be good for them only. But they don’t understand it. Do you have any such idea in your mind that can be done ? Sometimes if we want to get some things done, then we will have to bribe them saying you come and then you will be given something or something free would be done for you. Then they will come, but after that they may or may not complete the medicine.', 'These people are doing whatever according to their wish. Yes.', 'If there is any tension or worries in the house, and they cannot tell it in the house, then is there anybody important person for the family outside the house to whom they would confine it to? When they become free, they sit with each other and talk to each other. And tell them that they have these kind of problems. Sometimes they would solve it within themselves. Sometimes they go to dispensary or sometimes they will come to us also. They would tell us that they have this problem and ask what should we do. Then we advise them.', 'Okay, but suppose there is another kind of problem like problems between husband and wife, among children, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother, sister etc. And if they cannot talk to anybody in house, do they go outside and talk to somebody? Yes', 'Whom will they talk to? They talk to their relatives or in their neighborhood. Depending on the relationship, the other person may be able to influence and try to sort out the problem. In our area there had an incident. There was one lady who was married, but her husband was roaming with another woman. So they fight everyday .He drinks alcohol a lot and beats her also. The way he beats, we can’t watch even, as he beats ruthlessly. She tells me everything, then I explain to that person and he listens to me, but once he drinks he loses his mind and forgets everything. He tells me that his wife keeps reminding him of whatever he want to forget about. Then I explain to that lady also. The one who keeps the relationship only knows about it. Once these people drink they don’t understand about what they are doing. Alcohol is a very bad thing and because of that lots of fights are happening. Because of that only, people go on wrong path.', 'Majority of people over here drink? Everything has gone from their house. Money has gone and they had to keep their whole house as guarantee for getting money. They have lot of debts so that they had to keep their house as guarantee for getting money.  In  between the wife and children went to village. In village she is working and he is just lay down here. The earning in the village was not sufficient, so they came back here. The lady have some problem in her kidneys, so we admitted her. We don’t know what will happen now. Physically she is  very sick  and she cannot do hard works. But her daughter has now become around 15 years old. She goes for work in bungalow. Sometimes we support them. If there is some need then we talk to the institutions and they also support them.', 'Lot of people must be coming to you, right? There are 200 houses. If there is any problem then the ladies would come to us. Then we talk to them like if there is any need in the house, or anything to be talked to the in-laws. Then we talk to them and explain to them.', 'Everybody cannot talk to each other, right? Will the in-laws listen to whatever you say? Yes, they will listen. We have to put an effort. We will have to go once or twice. Then they would say “Yes, sister, whatever you say” and they agree. Directly nobody will say yes, but once we explain then they understands.', 'Do they have relationship like if somebody is my first friend, so fast, so close that if he tell something I cannot say no. Do they have such relationship within themselves? Yes, such relationship are there. But if there is any conflict , then they would fight also.', 'Okay like that ? Does that fight last for long period of time or in 15 minutes they become friends again? No, if somebody comes in between and explain them, then they understands. But sometimes somebody might keep enmity in the heart also. They even kill their own brother also.', 'Oh, is it so? Do they do murder or like that? Yes, that is also there. If night comes, we always think whether it will go alright or not.', 'That means everyone is strong headed? Yes. Suppose when a man is passing by here, when we see him we feel like he is a simple man. But when we talk to him, initially we feel like he is a simple person. But once we finish the conversation ,we realize that he is quite a dangerous person.', 'So all these happens only after drinking alcohol or just like that everyone is strong headed? Everyone is strong headed and no body is quite or simple.', 'And alcohol only triggers it. Is it so? Yes.', 'Is there  a problem here like the children should not come out in the night? Yes, there is this problem here that the children cannot go out in the night. There is little fear because if there is occurring any internal rivalry then they sometimes might do something wrong like kidnapping the children or sometimes killing them also. So this problem is there. Recently one incident happened , further on the road there was a potter. From their house somebody kidnapped a five year old girl in an autorickshaw. Therefore they don’t let the children to go out that much. They have to be careful with the fear that their children might get kidnapped. Because even if there is occurring a normal internal fight, somebody may keep it in mind and try to take revenge. Therefore there is this problem here.', 'So lots of problems are there. Yes.', 'Do they send the children for studying? Yes, they send.', 'Do they send girls? Yes, they send girls also. Before they used to make girls study till 4th  to 5th class. But now many girls studies up to 10th or 12th  and many girls have completed their graduation also.', 'There must be very few girls like that. Yes , very few. Only 25 to 30 percent girls must have done the graduation. But till 10th many girls have completed.', 'How about after 10th ? After 10th ,they have their household responsibilities. If there are house problems then they go for work. So they leave their studies. Or else they will have to take care of their younger siblings and so they leave their studies. And nowadays the atmosphere is not very good, so they don’t allow the girls to go out much, thinking that the girls might go on the wrong path if she goes for studying. They have these feelings, so they don’t allow girls to go out. Sometimes when we have programmes and we want to call them, then we will have to explain to them. Then they send the girls on our responsibility by saying that “Madam, if you take the responsibility, then only I will send my daughter, otherwise I will not send”. Here these problems are also there.', 'But the programmes are during day time and still they would not send? Yes, programmes are during the day, but they will not send. Because from here the girl may take excuse and run away. Here there is lot of this kind of problems. Therefore they don’t easily agree. They send them only on our responsibility saying that “You are taking her, so you only bring her back”.', 'So don’t have trust on their girls. No, they don’t trust their girls. Here lot of such incidents happens, so  they hardly allow.', 'That means they runs away with boys? Yes.', 'But they must be very young. What will be the age of those who come for the programmes? Usually 15 to 16 years old girls run away.', '15 to 16 years old girls run away? 11 to 12 years old girls would say that he is calling me or that boy is calling me. These things happens. Because children always learns from their home atmosphere and in their house itself, they have these kind of atmosphere.', 'You were saying that lot of people drink alcohol. So do they only drink in the night or they drink during the day also ? All the time they drink, can be day or night or both. Here there is a place where you get all things like Charas, Nanja, etc.', 'It must be their seat kind of a place. Yes, it is their seat kind of a place where different types of men come. Everybody come there. This is our anganwadi and it is very near to our anganwadi.', 'It must be their seat kind of a place. It is close by to each other.', 'Is it close by to each other? Then is that causing any trouble for you? He is a sage person.', 'Is it close by to each other? Then is that causing any trouble for you? He is a Pujari.', 'Is it close by to each other? Then is that causing any trouble for you? People think that there is a Maharaj or a priest sitting, but they all take Charas, Ganja and it goes on.', 'Oh, and it is going on. Then does it create any problem for you? No, it is not creating any problem for us. In fact they tell us like “Sister if there is any work, please tell us or if anybody troubles you, inform us”. So in a way they are good, but in a way they are spit fire kind of people. You can’t poke them and only just talk how much ever is necessary.', 'Oh, and it is going on. Then does it create any problem for you? Recently there was a fight in the center.', 'Was it in the community center over here? Yes. They stay good with us, but in a second the relationship may get spoiled. They don’t realize that I have such a good relationship and so sometimes I should compromise. They don’t compromise.', 'Oh, it should be there. While eating, do they eat sugar and masala? No, they eat very less sugar or jaggery. These people don’t eat sweet.', 'Don’t they eat sweet? Yes, spicy and fried items they like to eat more.', 'They like to eat spicy and fried items more? Yes, they eat lot of oily food. For their Sabji, there will be a layer of oil floating on top of the Sabji. We don’t make Sabji like that. On top of that they pour raw oil in Sabji for the kids, so they don’t find it spicy.', 'Is it so? That means they are not very fond of sweets. No, if we make some sweet and give them, they would not eat. We have to force them to eat. If we give them spicy food, the kids would eat.', 'Then if they eat so much spicy, then will they have some problems like acidity? Here they have eaten spicy food right from the beginning, so they can eat. Sometimes when we see their food, we feel like how can a child eat such a spicy food. But child eats.', 'The child eats? Yes, we have not seen any problem because of that.', 'So they need tasty food and they cannot eat bland food. They will not at all eat bland food. They want spicy food. They grind and make masala of the spices and then they make Sabji.', 'So they like to eat good food, how much ever they get. But it has to be tasty. Otherwise it would not do. Yes, it has to be tasty, otherwise it won’t do.', 'So when we see that there is so much of chillies and spices, which is not good, does anybody like a person from outside like you or a person from the center or a doctor give them any advice ? Do they advise them that you should not put so much of chilli and will they listen to it? No, they would say that we want like this only.', 'So when we see that there is so much of chillies and spices, which is not good, does anybody like a person from outside like you or a person from the center or a doctor give them any advice ? Do they advise them that you should not put so much of chilli and will they listen to it? They say we don’t find the taste.', 'So when we see that there is so much of chillies and spices, which is not good, does anybody like a person from outside like you or a person from the center or a doctor give them any advice ? Do they advise them that you should not put so much of chilli and will they listen to it? Yes, they say we don’t like the taste. Because they say we have only roti and Sabji to eat. So we like spicy only. They don’t eat bland food. They say our children also would not eat such bland food.', 'So they are not ready to leave that. No, they cook like that only.', 'Do you have any idea about that they had tried any time like “Okay, today we don’t put spice and let’s check how does that food tastes”. No, it’s not like that.', 'So it is like continuing what is going on since so many years. Yes, it is like that.', 'So they don’t want to experiment. No, they don’t want to experiment.', 'Do they have the understanding that extra chilli, sugar and oil are harmful to body and so if we reduce it little bit, it will benefit us. Do they have this kind of knowledge or no? They have knowledge because when we do meeting we tell them that when you eat a particular thing it harms you this way. But they have this mentality that we will eat what we are eating and we like spicy food only, we cannot eat bland food.', 'They cannot leave that. No, they cannot leave.', 'Then if doctor recommends do they leave or is it like that only. Then I don’t know. But they hardly do.', 'Yes, but you take them to many doctors, know? Doctors will tell so many things like that you should not eat salt and all. But they would eat only what they are eating.', 'They would not listen to doctor also? No, there was one lady who had pressure, that means blood pressure problem. She was pregnant and from that time itself she had the blood pressure problem. I told her that you should eat less salt. But she said I don’t like that food. And she was taking salt.', 'So they continue eating. Yes, they continue.', 'They know everything about what they should not eat or what should they eat. Yes, they know everything. But what they are continuously doing, they will continue to do it.', 'Now you said that lot of people just keep laying idle over here. And as lot of parents come in anganwadi, you must be having an idea about who is working, who is not working, who keeps roaming about. Then do you give any advice to them or no? No, we can tell only to ladies. We can talk everything to ladies. With ladies we can speak with our own right. But with gents we also get little scared by thinking that if we tell something and if something goes wrong, then. Like that we also get little scared with gents. But yes, there are some who are regular and we know that if we tell them they would listen to us. We talk to such gents. Then they would do the work.', 'Are there any groups here? Like area wise that in a particular area particular kind of people stay and they have their leaders and their community and there is next such group. Like that is it divided? No, it’s not like that. Variety of people stay here. It is not like that suppose it is Vanchara, then only Vanchara and their community stay in one area. Everybody like Parmar, Chamar, Solenki Vanchara stays here. And everybody stay together. But they have the feeling that certain people are Bhangi and we should not eat food from their house. They have that kind of things.', 'Is it so? Yes, initially we had this issue that people from upper caste would come and also people from lower caste would come and they would say like ”Sister, please don’t make them sit with them or don’t give their things to us.” Then we ask them “Why so? Here everyone is equal”. Then they don’t create problem. When we explain they understand.', 'Is there any rule of goons kind of a thing over here? Yes, it is definitely there.

Normally if there is any matter of concern, then they would stand opposite to each other and will be ready to fight.', 'They make big issue out of small things? Yes, they make issue out of small things.', 'Do they have any idea about diabetes like what is diabetes and how does it happens? For diabetes when it happens to them and when doctor tells them, they realize. We also tell them. We had a camp over here for diabetes and that time we got everybody checked up for diabetes. Then many people were normal and also found that many people have diabetes. But then only a few people did the full process of checkup and all, whereas others did not continue the process. They say like “Let it be sister. We will have to manage it each and every day.”', 'Oh for the reason that they have to take medicine every day, they don’t do ? Yes, they have to take medicine everyday and they have to make it as a routine. They say that new sickness and new medicines keep coming. So many people left and many people did the checkups again, did further processes and started medicines also.', 'So what are the information been given at the time of camp? Do you have any idea? Can you explain again?', 'What are the information given in camps regarding diabetes ? Like you explain to them right, that this sickness is caused due to these reasons, these are the effects and so that these body parts get affected due to the sickness. These kinds of information are given to them or is it only checkup done and just inform them that they have diabetes or no ? We had spoken to them that here there is diabetes camp and if the checkup is done, it is good. Also whatever information we know like the body gets weak, we get tired easily, you cannot remain hungry, etc. , we ask them that whether they have any of those symptoms. Then some of them said yes. Then we took them for checkup.', 'That means they didn’t have any idea regarding this. No, they don’t have any idea about it that those symptoms could be the reason for a disease. But we give them the information.', 'Okay, so then they do. Because most of them are illiterate. And so they don’t have any idea.', 'Generally how much they have studied? Till what class? Now the big people are mostly illiterate. Hardly studied till 4th or 5th class. And children also go, but it is only as per their wish. If they want to go, they would go. Otherwise they would not go.', 'When the camp was conducted, were you in contact with them? In your area of anganwadi, how many houses were there under the effect of diabetes or may be not? Do you have any idea? No.', 'Suppose a person has gone with you for the checkup, then you would know that this person has diabetes. Like that in how many houses people have diabetes? In my area when I brought people, two people had diabetes. They have already started medicines. Because he kept falling sick again and again and so his checkup was done. So he had diabetes at that time. So I had brought him here also to check diabetes.', 'Is it possible that in that area lot of people must be having diabetes and since they have not done checkup neither they nor you know that they have diabetes. For example when somebody feel giddy or if they get cut and don’t get healed, like that when 2 or 3 symptoms gather together like stomach pain, throat pain, etc. then we tell them that you must be having this problem. So go and get it checked. And they have not gone for checkup. So it is not being diagnosed. So can that occur like people have diabetes and they don’t know that they have it? Is it possible? Yes, it is possible. Because they do just what we ask them to do. It is not like that I have the problem, so I should go and do the checkup. They just bring medicine and so it is over.', 'So they just go for temporary solution. Yes, temporary solution. Here there are lot of dispensaries in the interior areas. Or they just go to regular doctor and take the medicine. Then if doctor suggests then they do or otherwise they let it be.', 'You must be having an idea about diabetes like what is it. Yes, I have little bit of information about that.', 'Which body parts are affected? Which other complications diabetes may leads to? Do you know? First if we have diabetes, when we get cut it will not get healed. It gets puss, then we need to do the checkup. If we feel fatigue or too much of sweat, also when we feel like to eat sweet too much, these are the times when we should the checkup for diabetes. Like this I know a few things. Which was the other question you asked?', 'That ,which body parts does it affect? Yes, when diabetes goes very high it harms our eyes and some parts of the body may get paralyzed.

There are some  girls who come here and keep talking to boyfriends on phone.', 'Yes, when they cannot talk at home, they come out and talk to their boyfriends. We tell them to not to do like that over here, because our name will get involved in the issue and it might create problem for us. There are some girls who take the name of coming to anganwadi and runaway. There has happened one such incident in my anganwadi. She has told her mother that she is coming to anganwadi. Mother thought that she is here in my anganwadi and she came here asking for her. I told that I haven’t seen her right from the morning. Then her mother told that her daughter told her that she is going to anganwadi and had ran away.', 'Do they come back or not? No they come back after 2 or 4 days and either they compromise with parents or separation happens.', 'Are there people who use the phones for good cause, for example like the institutions or NGOs doing placement services by giving call to people and informing them about a vacant post and asking them if they would like to apply for that ? There are many such good usages for phones and do the girls use phones for such good causes or they even don’t know about it. I don’t have any idea about that.', 'What is the usual job of the people over here ? Labor.', 'What type of labor? They do street selling, lifting gas cylinder and do jobs in shops.', 'Do they work in shops or they run their own shops? No , they don’t have their own business, everybody do the labor only.

We were not sure that they will be able to continue and so we gave them their money back.', 'Do they have their own bank account ? Each and every house must be having their own account. They are doing this kind of in house purchie.', 'What is this purchie? Support there are ten ladies, they make group in house and everyday they deposit 10 or 20 rupees. Then monthly they will do the draw and whose name comes in it, all the money goes to that lady.', 'They give all the money in that? After that you need to continue keep depositing for a year. The advantage is that if somebody needs money in emergency then she can use that money.', 'When the name is picked in the draw, all the collected money is given to her? Yes, it is given to her and she need to continue depositing for a year. For example if per month we have to pay 100 rupees, so for one year it becomes 1200. Suppose for the first month I pay 100 rupees and when my account opens, then everyone need to give me their 100 rupees and I will get 1200 rupees in first month itself. But now I have to keep paying 100 rupees every month for  a year.', 'Does it mean that when her account opens, chit need to be picked only for her name and doesn’t she get money? No, she gets money. It is like how we do the draw. Suppose there are twelve people, it becomes 1200 rupees in a month. Now when we put chit of 12 people today and her name opened. Then the collected 1200 rupees is been given to her. And everybody need to deposit 100 rupees per month and like that it is done for 12 months. Suppose she doesn’t need that money at that time then we give the money to the lady who is in need.', 'That means every month everybody deposit 100 rupees and if nobody needs money in emergency , then you pick the chit?

So you talk to those parents know. Yes.', 'So what kind of behavior do they have? And what is their daily routine life? I wanted to know about that. In everyday life, the issue is that they stay in a joint family and they have houses of one or two rooms. There are 5 to 6 members staying in that space itself. Mother-in-law and father-in-law would be there. Younger or elder brother-in-laws would be there. And they all stay together. Mostly it is like that. Everyone like gents go for their job in the morning and ladies leave their kids and go for work in bungalows. They go for these daily labor jobs. And kids stay with old people who are there at home, like grandparents. Or if there are elder brothers or sisters, then they make them leave their studies and keep them to take care of younger siblings.', 'So is it that they have to leave their studies and do household work? Yes, for household work. If there is elder sister then they drop her studies after 6th or 7th class, then she has to take care of her younger siblings and parents go for work. If we bring younger siblings to anganwadi, then parents take these girls to bungalows to help them.', 'Okay. But they make them drop from their studies.', 'Okay, so if we try to see approximately how many people must be staying in one house, 7 or 8 or 10. In many house it is like sometimes 3 people are also there like husband, wife and they have only one child or two children. And in many houses they have three sons. I will give you an example of one house that we have. There is one house where they have two sons and both are married. So their wives are there and they both have two kids each. And then grandfather and grandmother. So four twos are 8 and with grandparents it becomes 10. And their two daughters are unmarried. So 12 people are staying. And they have only one room and one kitchen. And in the kitchen itself, in one corner there is toilet bathroom. They use that. And how we make attic, like that they do half partition and they sleep there. They stay like that.', 'Okay, but if you have to tell one number like generally these many people are there, then what number you can give? 4 to 5, or 5 people would be approximately there. Only hardly there are families where 3 people are staying together like those who are newly married or separated, those people.', 'That kind of people must be less know. Yes, like that very less. But mostly more are there.', 'So how many children usually everybody has? These people feel that one child is not enough and everybody should have 2 to 3 children. If they have 2 or 3 daughters then they want to have a son. So there is lot of importance for a male child. They want a son.', 'That means 3 or 4 children would definitely be there. Yes, they have 3 to 4 kids. Also they have this belief that till they have 2 children the birth hair from the head will not be removed. So minimum 2 kids they will have. Because they have to remove the birth hair from the head which is called as Babri in our community. And to remove that 2 children are needed compulsorily. Either after having two daughters they can remove the hair or after having two sons they can remove the hair. Or if they have one son and one daughter, then they can remove the hair. But if there is only one then the Babri cannot be removed. Minimum two children should be there. Also they don’t readily believe in family planning. But now after so many years of effort from the side of anganwadi, now when we explain to them then they agree.', 'How many years back you joined here? I am working here since past 11 years.', '11 years? Yes, 11 years.', 'And in the same anganwadi? Yes, in the same anganwadi.', 'Where is your anganwadi? If you come straight on the same road, then 30, OD Marvadi Chaul is there. I work there, in the same area.', 'Which community people are higher in number in that area? There Solenki and Marvadi, but mostly Marvadi are there. But Chauhan, Gohil, Solenki, Parmar and Bajak families are more. There are 3 or 4 Bajak families, but Chauhan, Gohil, Solenki and Parmar caste people are more.', 'So what are they called, like Vankar? They are called Marvadis. They are all Marvadis and they are all from Rajasthan side. Dhanera Rajasthan, Rani Vada. These Marvadis are from that side.', 'And where do you stay? I stay in Ranip.', 'Where in Ranip? My aunty stays there. My father’s sister stays there. In Ranip, in vegetable market, there is a society called Neminath Society. I stay there.', 'My aunty stays near Nirnay nagar. Oh , Nirnay Nagar. It is quite far from there.', 'Now they have such a big family and sometimes there may occur internal clashes between husband and wife or father-in-law and mother-in-law. And if they cannot tell about that in the house, then outside with whom do they talk ? These people have problems in their house. When they come to drop their kids in anganwadi, then we ask them “Bhabhie, why is your face so unhappy today ? ” Then immediately they start telling their household problems to us. Then many a times we tell them that “Bhabhie, it is a joint family, so we have to bear little bit. Just like this everything will be done and your kids also grow. Then there won’t be any problem.”', 'So in front you itself they speak everything. Yes, in front of us they share a lot of their household matters.', 'Then how the neighbors and all? Yeah, they tell neighbors. But then sometimes the neighbor might tell to mother-in-law or sister-in-law. So they don’t share immediately with the neighbors. But they share with us. Even if there is a matter between husband and wife, then they share those matter also with us.', 'That means you will be very close to them. Yes', 'Now if you see a house, then who is the smartest of all in the house in everything? Smart, not like that. In their house it is like whatever mother-in-law says, they have to do that. Not only mother-in-law but also father-in-law. Daughter-in-law cannot have her own way. Not even her husband. Till mother-in-law and father-in-law are there, they will have their say in the house. Mostly they are given importance.', 'But then in worldly affairs and in practical life, who is the smarter one ? Their wives are smarter.', 'The ladies, right. Yes.', 'Is there affection between children and mother? Yes', 'Is their relationship strong? Or I have seen here many a times that kids do whatever they want to do. In this the relationship is strong, but the matter is mother has more feeling for the kids. But the thing is that their fathers have some or the other bad habits or addiction. Here definitely they have addictions. Many a times they drink alcohol and come. Then they beat the woman. So the woman is tired of the entire situation and trying to manage to meet the both ends of the household. While managing this situation of the house, they behave rudely towards kids by saying “Get lost from here, let me do my work”. Because they have to reach on time for doing bungalow work or they have to reach on time to the place where they are doing job and also do the household work. And if husband drinks alcohol and comes home, then they have to bear them also. So by considering all these situations, sometimes they show their anger on their kids. Because she is a lady and she cannot show her anger on any body except her own children. This is what happens.', 'Who is taken care the most in the house? Gents are taken care the most in the house. If son is there he would be taken care of. They take less care of girls. They take more care of boys.', 'That means more than their husband, they take care of their 1 or 2 sons. Yes', 'So mother-in-law and father-in-law are also not taken care as much the sons are cared. Right? No.', 'And who takes care, mothers? Yes, their mothers only take care of them.', 'Or else sometimes there might be some cases, you know, where mother-in-law takes lot of care of daughter-in-law. We get only very few family like that. There are only very few mother-in-laws who are able to understand their daughter-in-laws. But we don’t see all mother-in-laws like that in the area.', 'So mostly it is the mother and their sons. Yes, they take care of their own sons.', 'Then do sons take care of their parents ? No, sons don’t take care of their parents. They are like that only.', 'How people give advices to each other? Is it there or everybody does what they want to do ? You said it is the mother-in-law who is ruling. Yes, the mother-in-law dominates in the house.', 'But isn’t it there that in day to day life, wife gives advice to husband like “Don’t do this”. No, if husband has come home as drunk and if she tries to give any such advice, then he would beat the lady.', 'Then the mother-in-law would not say anything? No, they don’t say anything.', 'Oh, they don’t say anything. Only hardly in some families we see like the mother-in-law takes the side of daughter-in-law. We only see such incidents very less.', 'Taking side is okay, but. But they don’t ask to them that “Why do you drink and come”. They say like “He is your husband and if he beats you, you have to bear it”. Mother-in-law say like that only.', 'They say like that only? Yes.', 'Do they give any advice to children or not even to children also? No, the children will see their parents behavior and learn that only. Children come to us and tell us their household matters like “Yesterday my father came home drunk and beaten my mother too much ”. And then we go to meet the mother, as during afternoon we have  to do the house visits for five houses and that time we go and ask them that “Bhabhie, were you have been beaten in this way”. Then she says “Yes, he beats. But then what to do? I cannot go to my mother’s place also and now the kids are also there. Where will I go by leaving the children ?”. They say like this. Because husband goes for work, comes back and goes for drinking. So he is not in his senses. Then how he would take care of the children. So lady bears this much.', 'She can take the kids and go away know. Who will keep her then ? In parents house also same kind of brothers and sister-in-laws will be there.', 'Like the same way? Yes, then who would keep her?', 'Oh, then would not have either place. Yes, so the poor lady gets suffered from both the sides. This is what happens.', 'Then what about the small advices like “Come home in the night at a particular time or don’t eat from outside.”? Everybody eats outside foods. But after anganwadi had started, it had reduced because we hardly allow them to bring packets from outside. And we cook fresh snacks over here and give them. Because of that malnutrition has been reduced to quite an extent. Before when we started the anganwadi, then all the children were malnourished.  But now slowly it has been reduced. Now their mothers tell us that “Sister, after eating your snacks, when children come home they don’t eat food at our house. Once they eat at your place, then in the evening only they need food.”', 'Their stomach must be getting filled. But here their grandparents and mothers have given this kind of habit to them that when they go out of the house, the child asks for one rupee from them. And when they give this one rupee, then children immediately get something from outside. They don’t bring it to anganwadi. But they eat it from near or around their house in rest of their time. These children have not forgotten that habit. We tell them to get one piggy bank for them and develop the habit of depositing money in that. But still that has not come. We are explaining to them about that slowly.', 'So these ladies are there, will they be giving advices to their children that you take one rupee, but do not eat outside food or something like that. Yes, mothers tell. But then mothers go outside. After that children will go out and buy and eat it.', 'Suppose if we force them, then will they listen? They would listen, but the grandparents are there. They would say “Okay take this money, go outside and eat the food.” So grandparents also teach such things to children. This is what happens.', 'See, now you have an experience. So do you feel like if we change few things, then children will start listening to their parents and start respecting them. Yes, in anganwadi, we have taught kids to say “Namastey”. Then we tell them to say “Namastey” to their grandparents also. But from the house these grandparents don’t show any such habits. But when we go anganwadi and tell to children “Namastey”, then they will immediately reciprocate. Then when we leave for going home, we have the habit of saying “Jay Ambay” to kids. Then till we reach outside the kids keep saying “Sister, Jay Ambay . Teacher, Jay Ambay”. Many a times supervisors comes from outside to our place, then the kids  say “Good, morning” also. Because we had taught these kind of things to children in anganwadi. So they learn a lot by seeing us. Many children from anganwadi have got admissions in good schools also. And they bring very good result also. Because “Right to education” has started and in that many boys and girls had got admissions and they learn very nicely. There is a girl called Maya in my area , she has taken admission in school of Lakshmi. This time she has got 1st rank in the school.', 'Very clever, know. Yes, her teacher had called me to the school. So when I went to meet her, she told me that “She gives the answer when I ask her anything, at any time. And when I teach songs she also makes everybody sing very nicely”. So her teacher said that “You had trained her very nicely and sent”.', 'You feel happy and proud, know. Yes, her mother took me when she went to take the results saying that “Sister, you taught her and that is why she has gone to a good school”.', 'So you are seeing the results slowly here. Yes. Now slowly  and slowly we are seeing the results of our work. But still it will take little more time.', 'But should there be any change brought in house, so that the children would start listening to their parents? Yes, to bring change in the households, first of all alcohol should be stopped. Once father stops getting intoxicated, then there will be love which will be developed amongst parents and children and their relationship will improve. Because when he comes drunk, he beats children and also their mother. Seeing that children become unhappy and immediately they share their household matters with us. They have the feeling that if there is someone for them, then it is only anganwadi sister. So they share any household matters with us.', 'Now, if we see a family, is there anybody outside the family who is important for them or as a well-wisher for them? Is there anybody like that? No, I don’t think so.', 'Sometimes it is like that somebody from outside becomes an important person for some people. For example, in my family it is like that my father’s brother or my father’s sister’s husband, I can go and talk to them. I know that they are my well-wishers. Here they stay in a joint family with uncles or the uncles stay in neighborhood. Then they are attached to them. That means they have relationships with them.', 'Suppose there is a leader in a community. And if he say something, do they listen to him? Yes, may be the parents listen to him because they belong to a particular caste. Sometimes they have to take decisions like when they got their children engaged and they don’t like their matching with each other after that, then if they want to break that engagement, then they will have to gather everybody from their caste. And in that whatever decision is taken has to be implemented. It is like that.', 'Are there any such people like if he says something he cannot be denied? Like how?', 'For example, there are leaders and when he goes and tells somebody that you have to do this, then he cannot say no. Are there any such people? No, the thing is that these believe a lot in superstitions. So they believe in their goddess. They also believe in ghosts and Bhuvas. They say that our priests has told like this, so we have to do like that. If we don’t follow it, then things will go wrongly with us like our child may die ,goddess would not take care or things will go wrong with us. They believe too much in these things. I will give you one example. There is a boy called Sagar coming to my place. He is very mischievous. He makes too many mischiefs. So I told them that he does a lot of mischiefs and so give him something so that he doesn’t feel like doing mischiefs. Give him to do some activities whole day, then he will not do mischiefs. Then mother told that “Even if I beat him too much, then also he does too many mischiefs”. Then I told her to bring slate and pen for him and let him scribble. Let him do whatever he wants to do. Then she told “Sister, whatever I give him, he will not do it” . Then I asked her “Why are you saying that he will not do? He plays mischiefs in anganwadi also. I take care of so many children. Still he plays mischiefs with me. But I don’t let him sit idle. Many a times he do mischiefs like he opens his hair, he shows his tongue, broadens his eyes and scare other children”. Then I asked her “Bhabhie, why is he doing this? Have you taught anything like this from the house ?” Then she told that “There is Bhadha from our Kitlaji and therefore our kids will do like this.” I told her that I haven’t seen any such things and even if there is Kitlaji Bhadha children will not do like this. He has seen something like this from somewhere and that is why he is doing like this or he has got this kind of habit.  If he is doing some mischiefs like that, you stop him. Then she told “No, because we have this Kitlaji Bhadha and if he does anything like this, we cannot tell him anything. Whatever he asks for, we have to bring it and give it to him”. Then if the boy says I want to eat ice cream, then she would immediately bring it and give it to him even if he has eaten an ice cream just before that. I told her “Bhabhie, you should not do like this. Think about your other kids also.” And if his younger sister asks, she will not give for her. I told her ”Please don’t do like this Bhabhie. The young girl will feel bad in her heart that my parents are taking care of him only and not me ” .', 'Yes, and in small age it hurts more. Yes. Also there is a girl in my area called Tina. She is married in Nausari, but she use to come here. Her daughter didn’t go to toilet for two months and her stomach was bloated and became very big. Then I asked her “Tina, why your daughter’s stomach has become so much big”. Then she told me that she has not been gone to toilet for two months.', 'Two months? Yes, two months. And then I asked her that what happened. At least think little bit. And then I took her to a doctor and doctor gave medicines. Then with medicines she did lot of motions. She did at least 6 to 7 times. And from wherever she was sitting, from there she would keep spoiling everything and go. This thing got over and next day she got fever. Then I told her “Tina, you do one thing. She has fever, so you put wet cloth on her head” . But then she got seizures and so I took her to the dispensary. Then I called her husband and told him that this is what has happened and doctors had advised to admit her. I told him that “Right now we had given her the medicines. But you come because she is telling like she can’t admit the child in the hospital without asking her husband”. She cannot take any decisions regarding her child without asking her husband. They have to ask their mother-in-law and father-in-law also. Then the husband told “Sister, don’t take the child to the dispensary”. Then I asked him that who will take the responsibility when the child dies , just because she is a girl don’t you have any value for her life and if it was a boy you would have been ran immediately to the dispensary. Then he told no and we have this Kitlaji Bhadha and we cannot take her to dispensary. See this is how they believe in superstitions. They should be brought out of these superstitions. First of all these efforts are to be done. And also if alcohol is stopped, then lot of families will be saved. And they can go even ahead than us. Therefore these two are the main reasons for them to get spoiled. Also this differentiation between the girl child and boy child should be reduced from their mind. Because they give too much importance for boys and girls get very less importance.', 'Still is it like that? Yes, still it is like that. They have less liking for girls and more liking for boys, give better things for boys and for girls anything is okay. Such things are very prominent.', 'Do they have any financial problems? Monetarily they earn as good as us. They do much more hard work than us and earn. Like we come here at 9.30 and stay till 3.30 and we earn 4750 rupees monthly as salary. Whereas they go for bungalow work in the morning at 9’O clock and come back home at 3’O clock. Then their wives will earn around 6000 to 7000 monthly doing bungalow work. So they earn much better than us. But still they don’t know how to use that money properly or save it properly.', 'Do they have any financial problems? At home, we use to bring things to give it to our children. Whereas they spend upto 15 to 20 rupees per day for one child. They keep giving them one rupee and do like these 5 to 6 times per day to the child. Suppose there are 4 to 5 kids, then they give them one rupee in the morning, one rupee in the afternoon, one rupee when they come to anganwadi, one rupee when they reach back to home and in the evening also they give this one rupee to each child. So it became 5 to 6 rupees just like that itself. So if they have four children then 20 to 25 rupees will be gone just like that itself. So how to give money to children, or how to manage money, how to save money at the right time, all these things still they don’t know.', 'Then do they have any food problem, so that they avoid eating food at one time or something like that? No, they eat food very much.', 'How many times do they eat? In the morning they have Ghatiya with tea. They bring it in small quantities, as it is expensive for them. They don’t buy things from the people who comes to sell or from the shops by bargaining or by weighing it. They say like give for 10 rupees or give for 15 rupees. Like Ghatiya would be 70 rupees per kilo, so it will be 35 rupees for half kilo. They would not buy 500 grams and they will bring only for 10 rupees. So the other person will give only small quantity of Ghatiya. So it will be expensive for them. And only two or three people can eat from that much less quantity. Then when they again get up and make tea, then they will get biscuits or toasts. But then also it becomes expensive. Now when they make snacks in the afternoon, they bring dal for 10 rupees in retail. And people like us buy these in large quantity and store it with us. So this is becoming expensive for them. In this they don’t know how to manage things.', 'So everyday they bring things in retail and cook? Don’t they store for a year or bring ration? Yes, they bring in retail and they don’t store. They will get a lot of advantage if they are storing for a year or for a month. And now I tell them that instead of buying rice and wheat in retail, you store for a year. And you will have a lot of advantage.', 'Don’t they do that? Now in some families that habit is coming. Then they come and tell us that “Sister, this time I had stored this much wheat. Sister, I stored this much rice”. Now they had learned little by little.', 'So normally what do they cook every day. Everyday they have roti and Sabji or dal and roti. In the evening they have kichdi and roti.', 'What types of vegetables would they have? In many families, they use to have good amount of vegetables. Whereas in some families it is like there are 8 to 12 members as in joint family. They bring 250 grams or 500 grams of vegetable and they make it with lot of gravy. Everybody will not get proper nutrition from 200 to 500 grams of vegetables. That is the reason why the rate of malnutrition is increasing. And for small kids, instead of milk they give tea.', 'Do they give tea? Yes', 'So they have this habit right from the childhood. Yes, they give them habit of having tea only.', 'So in a day how many times they have tea? In a day 2 to 3 times they have tea.', 'So if somebody falls sick in a house, do they cook separately for the sick person? In cooking as separate they might make moong or they make kichdi. Rest all is whatever it is they are eating.', 'So they eat whatever it is. Is there nothing like curtailment or something like that? No, they don’t have any such things like curtailment or like that.', 'Do they enjoy only tasty food? Like they mandatorily need tasty food and they cannot do with bland food. Is it like that? They want spicy and food with onion garlic.', 'Oh, with onion garlic. Yes, here kids eat less sweet and people in this area also eat less sweet. But they eat spicy and food with onion garlic more.', 'Suppose sometimes when the food is cooked and it is having less spices, then will they manage or need it to be spicy itself? They will ask for chilli and put it? They eat more chilli. They have this habit, so they eat more chilli.', 'So it is not like it will do. It is not like that, right? No, they will not manage. It will not do.', 'Now if we check people of this area, are they fat, medium or thin? What kind of people are they? Some people like grandparents who stay at home and take care of kids and house, after daughter-in-law and son go for work, they have little heavy body. Whereas those who work, they have measured body.', 'Can we call them thin? No, they are like proper.', 'And how about the children coming to your place? The small kids are thin, they don’t get weight properly because they eat packet food from outside. In summer they eat that pepsi and ice, therefore they get cough and cold and keep falling sick again and again. So even if their weight get increased little bit, again it falls and comes down.', 'What is their activities during the day right from the morning? Of parents ?', 'Yes. For parents, fathers get up in the morning, take bath, have breakfast, then they get ready and go for work. Some of them come home to eat in the afternoon. If not, then they take tiffin and go out. In their tiffin they will have roti and Sabji only. They come home in the evening. After coming home they watch TV for some time. Then they sit together for some time. Then if anybody have any addiction, then that person goes out. Then they come home only after having their booze.  And ladies get up in the morning, do little bit of household work, sometimes get the children ready and sometimes they don’t, sometimes they give them bath and sometimes they don’t, and then they leave for doing bungalow work.', 'Sometimes they give them bath and sometimes they don’t. Is it so? Yes, many a times in anganwadi we make them clean and give them bath and get them ready. Many a times we gave them bath in anganwadi. May be by 3’O clock, 2’O clock or 2.30, as per their timings, their mother comes at home and till then children stay with us in anganwadi.', 'Okay, then they do cooking after coming home. Some of them may have made roti in the morning, then they make Sabji after coming home at 2.30 or 3.00. And they eat. And sometimes what happens is that she might make roti in the morning and grandmother might make Sabji as she is sitting there. And then they come at 2.30 or 3.00 and then they eat.', 'Okay, after that do they do any work or no. After coming home they wash cloths, they clean vessels, they clean floor, etc. Then they take rest for some time and then they start work for the evening.', 'Do these ladies have any addictions? These ladies eat Kuber, Gutkha. And they also eat dirt.', 'They eat dirt ? Yes, ladies eat dirt. And their children also learn that by seeing them.', 'Oh, dirt means that smelling powder is there know, which is called as chikni. Not chikni. But yes, some people smell that smelling powder chikni. Old people smell that, but the younger ladies eat Gutkha and Miraj. They do have these addictions.', 'But they don’t  have addiction of these alcohol. No, they don’t have addiction of alcohol. Gents have addiction of alcohol.', 'Majority of gents might have addiction of alcohol. Yes, majority of gents have addiction of alcohol. Very few gents don’t have like out of 100 percent 80 to 85 percent have addiction of alcohol. Hardly 15 to 20 percent of gents don’t have addiction of alcohol.', 'Are you telling this by keeping in mind the whole community or is it only in your area? No, this is by considering the whole community, like by considering however many communities are there on the Tekra, that they drink alcohol.', 'That means there are lot of trouble because of that. Yes, that is a big trouble. If that is stopped then lot of family will progress. And many children will also improve. And there are many like who only drink some days, but  there are some who wants to drink every day. But so many is there like they have alcohol and when we meet them on the road as we come in front of them, when they are coming, they move to the side of the road. They give that much respect to us.', 'They didn’t had given any trouble to you. No, they don’t give any trouble to us. When we came here, initially we used to get scared. They were not troubling us, but we were getting scared. When a drunk person comes in front of us, we used to get scared. But now we don’t get scared. They go by the side of the road or they hide themselves. They respect us that much.', 'And like everybody go for work ? Yes, everybody go for work. Hardly 5 to 10 percent people may not be going for work and also having addictions. And their houses are ran by their wives. Even though they work, whatever they get they use for their addictions. And they give only some amount in the house.', 'Does it happen like they don’t give any money at all? Yes, it happens that they don’t even give and the house is ran on the salary of the lady.', 'How many of that kind? There must be very few, know? Yes, there are some family like that.', 'And does it happen like that he himself is not earning and he take money from the lady and use it for drinking alcohol ? Yes, many houses are like that also in our area ,that ladies are only going for work. And men are not going for work and they just drink alcohol and keep roaming whole day.', 'How many such houses must be there? Like that 5 to 10 percent houses must be there.', '5 to 10 percent? Is it so? Yes, that much can be found. In my area there are many houses where I see like he doesn’t go for work and keep drinking. And they must be working is like in a week 3 days he might go for work and 4 days he just keeps roaming. Then whatever he earns, he just uses it for drinking.', 'Like that mostly many must be doing ? Yes, many do like that.', 'Have you ever seen that somebody earns and gives all the money in the house and have no addictions? Yes, in my area 5 to 6 houses are like that. They give the money to their wives and then they take money only for their petrol and other pocket money kind of things. And their family run in a very nice way. I many a times tell them that “See Bhabhie, you are very lucky that in a such a community you had got a very nice husband”.', 'Then is there any who are aware about exercises like that physical exercises should be done in morning or in evening? Like that you will get 5 to 10 percent who goes for walk, doing some exercise. Hardly some will be there, but otherwise nobody.', 'Either doing Surya Namaskar or yoga ? No, only they give water to sun . Only that much. In my area there are only 3 brothers who go for morning walk.', 'So you are telling this numbers since you are having it correctly in your mind ? Yes, they are only 3 men. There are two Manoj Bhais and there is one Manish Bhai. Only those 3 are going for morning walk.', 'So people starting names with ‘Ma’ are going. Yes, I know it properly and they stay near to each other.', 'Oh, so it is the effect of their good company. Yes, and out of them 2 work in college as office boys and Manoj Bhai works in one grocery shop in Madhupura.  Their family is very nice. Their house girls also are given respect nicely. The Manoj Bhai who works in the Madhupura shop has two daughters and the other Manoj Bhai has two daughters and one son.', 'That means nobody does exercise at all. No.', 'But suppose if you go and try to tell them like around 30 minutes we should do, then will they listen to you ? They say we don’t have time at all and we have to run for doing our jobs. They say like these things are for bungalow people.', 'So the time is the factor that stops them. Yes, they don’t have time.', 'If they have time, they may do. Yes, they say that if they have time,  they may do. But they say like “Sister, we don’t need to do it”', 'So is it like they are lazy and they are trying to find some reason for not doing exercise. Is it so ? Yes, that is also there. Because many a times they are sitting at home, watching TV, drinking tea, spend time for chit chatting, etc. But they don’t do exercises.', 'Do you think that if we tell them these things, then it may start ? Yes, it may start.', 'Then how do we encourage them ? In that case we have to gather them and explain to them that for our body we must do exercise. If not more, at least little bit like even for five minutes we can do. And when we start from five minutes then we may be able to do it more.', 'So if we explain then the work can be done. Yes, if we explain, then slowly and slowly it will make difference. It may not make difference at once. But slowly and slowly they will understand.', 'Now if we try to see, how much sugar do they use ? They mostly use the sugar in tea, but not in Sabji or dal.', 'Only in tea? Yes, only in tea.', 'But they drink tea many a times in a day. 3 to 4 times in a day.', 'Then lot of sugar will go in the body. Yes, sugar goes in the body. But they have less rate of diabetes. They have more rate of TB. In this area we see more rate of TB.', 'What causes TB? TB is because of the thing that they drink alcohol and their lungs get destroyed. So the outside infections are caught for them very fast and their houses are very close to each other. So it is like if I have some disease today and if I sit anywhere and then those bacteria spread everywhere. And then the other person has come as drunk, his immunity will be less or he has had alcohol in empty stomach, then those people catch diseases. So because of this they catch infection very easily.', 'So they catch infectious diseases more. Yes,  they catch infectious diseases more. We see more of infectious diseases over here.', 'So if then any doctor recommends to leave this particular thing or reduce to particular quantity, then will they listen to their advice ? Gents do not listen.', 'Gents do not listen? No and for ladies what happens is they have to ask mother-in-law and father-in-law and ask the gents in the house. And till those people don’t agree, the ladies cannot take a decision for herself also.', 'Is it so? Yes.', 'But suppose if the ladies had got some problem and doctor says to have less sugar or eat less salt or stop those things, then ? No, they cannot take such decisions immediately.', 'It is for their own self, then? No, they cannot do such things immediately.', 'Then what about when the doctor is explaining. Then there are hardly any ladies who can do those things. But we see it happening very less.', 'Suppose the mother-in-law is facing some problem, then? Then for mother-in-law they will cook with less salt for few days, but then after that it comes back to the same. That means it may work for a few days, but then it comes back to the same previous situation like how they were regular before.', 'Do they know that if we eat more sugar, it harms our body or we should leave it or we should reduce the quantity. Then it is benefiting for us like if we drink so much of tea, then lot of sugar goes in that. And there is so many people, so there is so much of usage of sugar. Then it is bad for our body. So do they know this? No, they don’t have any such knowledge. But now they come to anganwadi, so we tell them many a times that “You don’t drink so much of tea. More than that you all are giving tea to children, rather than that you give half bowl of milk to them”. So like this we  explain to them and tell them many a times. There are some families where they say that we have so many kids and for so many kids so much of milk we have to get. When we give half a bowl of milk, they would say I don’t want this much, I need full bowl of milk and so rather we give them tea only for kids also. So they give one bowl of tea only for kids.', 'Is it is so that when somebody has cholesterol problem or asthma problem, and if they are advised to reduce the salt and if he is a man, then can he himself take a decision that we should leave this ? No, they don’t decide that. You can see such thing at a very low rate.', 'There is no such possibility ? No, they don’t take such decisions.', 'Suppose if children like small kids are having some problem, then do they take care of kids or is it like letting the things go the way it is going on. No, it is like if the child has serious problems, then they take little extra care. Then when the child becomes alright, then they come back to regular situation as they were.', 'Now you were talking about TB, and in TB they will have to take care of lot of curtailment. Yes, it can happen to many children also. Lot of children get affected by it.', 'Then if gents are having TB, then they will have to do lot of curtailment in their eating habits. When gents have TB, what happens is if in the house there are small children of around 5 years, , then for the reason of not getting the child infectious, we have to give medicine for them also. Suppose if the father has, then we tell them that “Please do not spit anywhere. And if you spit then immediately pour water or put dirt on that”. Then what they do is in our presence they follow that. But in our absence we don’t know what they do. So many a times these things happen.', 'Now you were talking about medicine. Many a times when we go to the doctor, they give medicine for 15 days. But the child, gents or lady will feel alright in 7 to 8 days. Then they stop medicines? Yes, they leave the medication half way. If they feel better little bit, then they leave the medication half way. Then we have to keep explaining them and make them complete the medication.', 'They don’t complete the course ? No, there are many families where we make them complete the course. And there are some who leave it half way. And how much ever we explain to them, still they don’t complete.', 'That means till how much ever you can do, you help them. But after that, when you don’t even know, then how will you help ? Yes, when we come to know then immediately we help them, then only that person gets left by us. But as far as possible, we cover our area properly.', 'But they don’t understand themselves. No, they don’t understand themselves. And they come to dispensary only when they have too much of problems.', 'Is it so? Yes, when the problem is less, then they don’t go to dispensary. They say no and it will become alright. And they go to those small dispensaries and get medicine from there.', 'Is it same in children also? Yes, for children also they get medicines like that only.', 'Or is it like when children are small and if they fall sick, immediately they take them to doctor? No, when the children become too much sick, that time only they take them.', 'So they take them at a later stage. Yes, at a later stage.', 'So sometimes if it becomes serious, then? Yes, when it becomes serious, at that time only they take them. In that case also they are not ready to take the children to civil hospital immediately. Whatever medicine they get from the nearby doctor, they take and just manage it.', 'Then there are many ladies who know household remedies. Yes, they do household remedies. Also they have those Bhuvas. They do Dhora Dhaga from them.', 'They have Bhuva also? Yes. These things are still there.', 'Are these things still there too much ? Yes. They have the goddesses. Also they have their Bhuvas. So many a times we get this thought that, we should catch this Bhuvas and explain to them. Then only these people will improve.', 'It is true. Many a times we get that kind of thought. But after doing so much of work for anganwadi and then it is difficult for us to go and explain to them.', 'Do Bhuvas take money? Yes, they take money.', 'That means they are doing business only. Yes, they are doing business only. And there is no goddess who tell to not to go to dispensary.', 'There is no body who would tell such things. Yes.', 'Then don’t these people understands that these Bhuvas take money and the doctor also takes money and doctors are even educated. No, but they say that they do work for our goddesses and it is okay if we give them money. And if we go to dispensary and then if we take medicine and something serious happens to our children, then is the doctor going to save our child.', 'Yes, they will not save, only goddesses will save. They say our goddess is there and she will save our children.', 'Oh, okay. Yes, they believe like this.', 'Suppose is it possible that if we advise them to leave the tea, then will it work or no? No, we explained to them many a times that you all are drinking alcohol and leave it. Like in a day when the person is not drunk and when we go to their house, then we tell them “See brother, you have such a nice home and you are doing such a nice job, then why are you drinking alcohol. Leave it”. Then he says “No, I cannot stay without drinking alcohol and I have to drink little bit every day mandatorily”. They say like that and so they are not able to leave that.', 'And when they are drunk you cannot talk to them. No, we don’t talk to them at that time.', 'Do they keep this kind of Mannat that when this thing happens then we will leave that particular thing for goddesses. Yes, they keep such Mannat.', 'In what way is it? It is like if my this work is done, then I will offer coconut for so much of money or I will do this. But the kind of thing like “I will leave alcohol”, they don’t do. Or “I will leave Gutkha or Miraj”, they will not keep that kind of Mannat.', 'So, it is not possible to check their sugar intake, right? No, they are using sugar only in tea. But they drink tea at least 3 times a day.', 'Then while eating, do they have cooked some sweet in the house. No, they cook very less sweet in the house.', 'Then how is it cooked, once in 15 days or once in a month? No, it is not like that. They have very less sweet. When some guest come home, then they make Shira. Nothing else as sweet is cooked in their house. Sometimes they get those wheat bulgur and they get Lapsy from that. They don’t cook any other sweet. That also the children or people of house eat very less. They eat those in very less quantity. But they eat a lot of spicy food.', 'Can they leave chilli? No, and they eat spicy means they eat spiciest chilli whichever is available. They eat those. The chilli which is called as Patni Chilli. They eat those chilli which create more acidity.', 'So they must be having the problem of acidity. They', 'Do they suffer from acidity? Yes they do, but they don’t take it much seriously.', 'So they just bear it? Yes they just bear it. They say “Bhabhie, we use to eat spicy Sabji so that’s why we are getting that kind of heat”.', 'Oh so they understand but they don’t want to leave it. Yes they don’t want to leave and also they buy adulterated things which are sold in shops .They don’t buy good quality things. They feel that those are costly for them. Therefore they face more problems.', 'So many a times you tell children or make them do things. So do you advise them after going home also you should continue this? Yes. We tell children whatever exercise we make them do in anganwadi you inform or teach them to your parents also. So children do that and they tell their parents that my teacher did this today in anganwadi.', 'Do parents follow it? Yes when they come on the next day they ask us “sister, did you teach theses things to children”? Our children came home and were doing those things . They tell us like that.', 'Then many a times you have to go to their place to check also? Like you said TB medicines? Yes. Here the TB center is a bit far for them. So what we do is we keep TB medicine boxes in our anganwadi. Then we call them to anganwadi and make them have the medicines. Then sometimes they don’t come to have the medicines so we go to their house and make them have the medicines. We do these things.', 'Then do you have to take care that they do what you told them to do? For example you told them not to spit anywhere. Then afterwards do you take care? Do you monitor? Yes. We monitor them and tell them that  if you spit you have to put dirt on top of it and change that dirt every day.', 'Then how do you keep that kind of attention on them?  For that you have to be with them 24 hours. No. We don’t need to be with them for 24 hours but when we are there with them , for that much time we can take care of them and tell that you should spit on dirt only. So when we visit their house then we check whether they have kept the dirt with them or when they sneeze are they using a hand kerchief. Then if children have got cold, we give them hand kerchief to keep with them.  So that the child will clean his nose with that only.', 'So this is something what would have happened that when you sneeze or have cold use a hand kerchief.  But only when the child is in anganwadi you will be able to take care. But once they go home, then what happens? Yes. Till they are in anganwadi we take care but once they go home we cannot look after them.', 'Oh. There you can’t look after them. Then we teach children like when your mother is cooking ,tell her to wash her hands using soap first and then only cook and when everybody sits to eat ,tell them to wash their hands and then only sit to eat.  So many a times our children say these things in their home and to some extent it makes difference because of that. People told  us that yesterday when his father sat to eat without washing his hands , but then immediately he told his father to come and wash hands first and then only sit to eat. So the father agreed to him. If he is in good mood, he agrees. In such cases it makes a difference because of anganwadi.', 'Have they heard of diabetes? Yes. For diabetes there was a camp done from Manav Sadhna. In that we brought people from our area and did their report for diabetes. And for those who got diabetes  we call them again to do check ups and did follow up for them and if they have any small or big problems, we advise them to go to Civil wadilal only. Because if they go there, all their reports will be done there.', 'Yes. All the reports are done at one place? Yes.', 'So how much do they know about diabetes? They have little bit knowledge about diabetes.', 'How does it happen? What are the cares to be taken? Which part of the body get affected? When we go to visit them they tell us all these things like what kind of problems they are facing. And we tell them if you have to go to urinate frequently or after you pouring water after urination and still ants are coming there , immediately do the check up for diabetes. If you feel hungry or thirsty frequently then also do the check ups for diabetes. Then many a times they have fever and then they take medicine for  fever which makes a difference for some time. But when the condition doesn’t improve for permanently , we advise them to go to Arogya Kendra and get your check-ups done from there. There you get the reports for just 5 or 10 rupees. Many a times they get free reports also. So now they have little bit of information and knowledge.', 'But is this only in the houses where you visit or inform. Or does this include other houses also? We cover the population of 1000 people in which we have to visit 5 houses daily. So we cover the entire area in 1 month. And in those houses where we feel that there is more trouble, then we go there everyday also. Also when they come to drop their kids, that time also they talk to us. We frequently have these talks with each other.  If we saw them coming across the road, that time also we talk to them.', 'So you make them realize that if they got these kind of symptoms ,then do the check-up. But do they have any idea about the cares which should be taken if they have diabetes, like they have to eat less sugar. Yes.  We have told them that diabetes is a kind of a disease that mimic termite, like which it eats up your body from inside. So you have to take the medicines everyday and consult a doctor for check-up in every month despite your diabetes is increasing or reducing. If it becomes too low, then that is also not good. If it increases very high, then that is also not good. So now we send those people who are getting diabetes like this.', 'So they do have some kind of information? Yes. We give them these kind of information.', 'Do they have any knowledge about which parts of body get affected due to diabetes ? No. They don’t understand those things. Suppose we say if eyes or kidneys are affected, then only they come to know about this and the fact that diabetes leads to other diseases also.', 'Which are the other diseases developed? Do they know about that or no? Once the diabetes is developed, it also leads to other diseases like BP. And if the bones get infected, then we need to cut the bones as it cant be cured by medicines. If the patient get hurt by something then the wound is not healing easily, then the person might have diabetes. We give them this kind of information.', 'So before this they didn’t had any idea about all these? No, before they did not had any knowledge about this.', 'Now everyone must be knowing. No. Everyone may not be knowing. Only those people who are facing these problems and informed us about their conditions or who get informed by us have knowledge about it.', 'There must be only few people of that kind. Right? Yes. As we talk to them ,they come to know about it.', 'Do they have any idea that diabetes can be cured or not? No. They think that they got diabetes and it will never get cured. But we explain to them that you have diabetes and if you take medicines regularly, then it can be put under control.', 'Yes. It can be controlled. If you eat food properly from time to time and avoid those things that doctor advises you to do, then diabetes can be cured. So many people have now understood that and they are trying little bit. But what happens is that same food is cooked for everyone in a house and they all eat from that itself little bit.', 'So it might have happened like that the doctor have told them to leave something, but they have to eat in the house. May be its not their fault. But then do they feel guilty about it that I shouldn’t have eaten that? No. they don’t have any such feeling. They just say that this have been cooked for everybody know, and I ate from that only little bit.', 'So they have free mind. Yes. They eat like that.', 'So what do you think ? How many people have been affected with diabetes in this area? In this area people with diabetes is very less. But they get other diseases like TB because they eat things like Miraj and all. Also they don’t go for getting the reports. They only go to do the check up once the condition is worse. Overall diabetes is very less in this entire area.', 'Is there any chance that they must be having diabetes but we don’t have idea about it? Yes. There are chances. But we only come to know about that once we get reports. Otherwise we will not know.', 'What kind of work generally people do here? In my area most people are Marwadis. They have wood business.', 'They have their own business? They go to cut the woods or they work in wood workshop. Some people work in glass factory, and others do coloring work also. And the ladies go for bungalow works.', 'Nobody goes for collecting recyclable materials from garbage? In my area very less people go for that. In my  area there is almost nobody. There is one Chaul from where only people of hardly 10 houses do that work. Not more than that.', 'The rest go for work in bungalow? Yes. They go for work in bungalow. Then there are some houses where they have studied till 8th or 9th standard. They go for cooking also.', 'So they have to earn every day and cook everyday with that on a daily basis. Yes. They earn and eat on daily basis.', 'If somebody falls sick what they do? Suppose somebody falls sick and today there is no money, then? Then they keep their jewels for bond. They use silver jewels here and money lenders keep visiting the houses. Then they give loan. So if they took a loan of 12000 they have to give 18 installment of 1160 or 1200 per month. So many a times when I calculated, they give 2000 or 3000 extra in a year. I keep telling them that you are paying so much extra money. Instead of that you can save 100 rupees every month and use those money whenever you need.', 'Does it happen? A few people have learnt and they do savings. Also in Manav Seva we have this saving group and lot of people have joined in that.', 'How many such saving groups are going on? For loans?', 'No. Those who teach how to save. We explain to the parents who come to anganwadi to open one such account and deposit 100 rupees every month through post. So many ladies, who are daughter-in-laws, doing bungalow work deposit 100 or 200 in post office without the knowledge of their mother-in-laws.  And also many people have opened accounts in Manav Sadhna. Here they can do savings of 100 or 300 or 310 and so they have opened accounts like that.', 'Do they have accounts in banks? Yes. They have started it slowly. Because the government now has now declared that when someone has completed the 9 month vaccination for their kid and if they have BPL card, then they will get 2000 rupees. So they have opened bank account. In between there was a scheme for those who have completed vaccination can show the papers of vaccination and open a bank account. So now almost everybody has a bank account.', 'So everybody has a bank account? Yes. Everybody has an account in the bank.', 'Normally in which bank they do open an account? They have opened accounts in banks like DENA BANK,STATE BANK  etc. They have opened in SBI also.', 'Do they have insurance or no? No. they don’t do such things.', 'Don’t they even know about it? No, What they say is that  for taking insurance, there is lot of premium and once we die the money is useful for people after them only. They say better live with the money now and enjoy, rather than living in misery in order to save it. We tell them many a times that if you have insurance, it will be useful for your kids in future. But they ask us what is the use when we are dying living in misery and children enjoying it afterwards, rather we only use it right now.', 'Upside down thinking. Also sometimes there are few schemes where the government give skill development training for ladies and children. No. They just ask how much money they will get through this. After that only they will send them.', 'So they don’t want to do anything for themselves. No. They say like “You tell how much money will we get?”. That is what they say.', 'Oh, they need money only. There are many schemes provided by the government. So do they take advantages of those? Yes. They take advantage of government schemes. But many times they were not having the documents that are required for that. Like many a times they don’t register the birth of their child or sometimes they don’t have their grand parent’s death certificate. So their work get stuck when the account cannot be opened without those documents. Also when their names are not registered in the birth certificate, that also cause problem. Many such things keep happening.', 'Then there are many agencies like Manav Sadhna or NGOs which help them to give jobs. Do they take help from them or not? Many take their help and many don’t, because they think that the work they do in bungalows are better than the work from the agencies.', 'So then how do they search for work? Suppose if I am going for a work and if there the neighbor needs somebody to do the work, then we would contact other and inform them about this .', 'How about gents? Gents also search for work in the same way.', 'How do they get their salary? Is it on daily basis or monthly basis? Mostly it is monthly but people sometimes takes in advance also.', 'Isn’t it on daily basis? For those who do daily labor job, they get on daily basis also.', 'How many people do the daily labor job? There are many families like that. And many take monthly also.', 'What kind of work they do on daily basis? They do color painting or masonry work.  And if they go for the work of cutting wood, then they would be given 200 or 300 rupees per day.', 'So do most people work on daily basis? Many people do daily labor and nowadays there are people who do service also.', 'There are people who are doing service also? Yes. Many people do service also.', 'What kind of job they do? Many work as peon in offices and the young boys who learnt computer do computer related works also. They also do work like book binding in press.', 'So do they get salary on monthly basis? Yes. They get monthly salary.', 'Do they trust agencies like Manav Sadhna or NGOs? Yes. They have trust. And they have more trust on our anganwadi. They say that the Manav Sadhna and anganwadi is best and whatever it says is the right thing. Also they have the feeling that when the sister is telling something, then that must be right only.', 'That may be also because you are working here for so many years. Yes.', 'How was the response when you just started? That time it was less. That time we had faced lots of difficulties. But now they trust us. They listen to what we say.', 'Do they listen to everything you say? Yes.', 'Do they oppose you when you say something? No. They don’t oppose us. If we tell them to do things like this, then they do.

There are many applications done and is available in mobiles of this kind. Right now it is very expensive for us to make such an entire system. So right now we can purchase one from outside, which is ready made, and start the application. But to keep it continued we need some fund.

The new generation can do this. The old generation will not be able to do this.', 'Will they refuse? Yes. They may refuse. But the children of current generation will be able to do it.', 'Suppose we explain to those people, will they agree? We can explain them and slowly we can improve them.

No, \\xa0they will not do.', 'Even if the illness is serious? Yes. They will not do it.', 'Do they go to the dispensary? Yes, they go. But they stop the medicines as soon as they feel better.', 'Don’t they continue? No, They don’t continue.', 'Do they go to the dispensary even if they are feeling slightly unwell? Like will they go immediately if somebody has got fever or like that. Yes. They will go immediately, if they get fever or have recurring cough.', 'Suppose if they are feeling giddy, then will they go? Yes. Sometimes they may go or sometimes they will drink lemon juice. Since drinking water with sugar helps when we feel giddy, sometimes they do like that also.', 'Do everybody know these household remedies? Yes. Everybody knows that feeling giddy could be due to abnormal BP. They know like that.', 'Who all have these kind of knowledge? Suppose somebody has already faced problems like that and if I am having the same problem, then that person will advise and tell me that you might be having problem with BP.', 'No, not like that. Do grandparents know all these things? My mother knows a lot of things like if somebody feels giddy then lemon juice should be given or what to eat when a person has acidity or stomach pain. Like that are there people in the house who knows all these household remedies? The elderly people may know and understand that if a person is feeling giddy then lemon juice need to be given or if somebody gets acidity then should be taken to the doctor. Also they tell them not to eat fried foods.', 'Ok. So once they have acidity or something, do they go to doctor immediately or will they delay it by saying that it will become alright by itself? No. they go to doctor immediately.', 'You are talking about the people near your area. Right? Yes.', 'Are the people here fat or do they have body of proper weight? Some have body of proper weight and some are fat. There is a lady in our area of around 65 years old. She is very fat. She feels difficult to walk due to her weight. Meenakshi Ben told know about the camp. So that time we took her there and she had diabetes.', 'Oh, she had diabetes. Yes, she had diabetes.', 'That’s why her body became fat. Yes. That was the reason. But she has this fat body long time before itself. Now she has got to know about diabetes and started medicine also. And now further medication is going on.', 'Do you consider yourself fat or thin or of proper measurement? I have a body of proper measurement.', 'Okay, And how about people in your home? In my house I have 2 kids and my husband. My husband was thin before but he has put on weight by last 7 or 8 years.', 'Do you give him a lot of food to eat? No. He eats too much of outside food.', 'Don’t you eat? Yes, I also eats.', 'Then why haven’t you put on weight? I don’t eat food from outside.', \"You don't eat from outside. No, I eat homely food. We have a business of cotton wick, just like a labor only. When I go home I will do this cotton work for 4 or 5 hours. And in the next morning their father will take whatever I had made, to sell. \\xa0Now he does this hockery business in the morning and so he feels hungry, and eats snacks from outside. And after finishing his round, he comes to home at around 2 or 3 o'clock. So after coming home also he would feel hungry  and like that he eat too much of outside food. In the evening also he goes to do the business and takes round. If he feels like to come home and eat, \\xa0he does that.  Otherwise,  suppose when he meets his friends from outside, when used to eat snacks with them also.\", 'Is this business your own? Yes. It is our own business.', \"What is the activity of people around your area, the whole day? In the morning ladies finish their house hold work and go for jobs like cleaning floor at bungalows or for collecting recyclable materials from garbage. There is a court near Lal Darwaja where many ladies go for cleaning floor. They go there at 8 o'clock and come back at 12 o'clock. After coming back they do household works. And old people will sit together and do spiritual songs. Here in Manav Seva they play these spiritual songs. They go for spiritual songs in the evening for about one hour. The ladies have been given prayer beads also and therefore in the evening all ladies will go there and sit together to take god’s name with those prayer beads. They also take care of their grandchildren.\", 'How about their husbands of the ladies? Gents either may go for job or if some has the habit of drinking alcohol then they drink alcohol and do mischiefs.', \"Oh, they play mischiefs. Do they trouble anybody? No. They don't trouble somebody outside. There occurs only small fight or issue like suppose while cleaning our house if we had kept the garbage near to their house, then there might occur small fight and they might keep it in their mind or sometimes they may just forget it.\", 'Has anything such happened to you? No. It has not happened to us. In my area, everybody is good. But Meenakshi Ben has said know that in her area lot of Vanchara and Vaghri are staying. Vaghri community is of that kind. So in her area there are lot of such problems.', 'Is it near her house or in her anganwadi area ? In her anganwadi area. She comes from Bhavsar society and she is a Patel. I stay on Tekra and there people are nice. They give education to their sons. They give education to their daughters. My own son is doing BCA.', 'Very good. Yes. He goes to college. My son is on correct path. There are some houses where they do job and give education to their kids also.', 'Is such thing is there in the houses around your area? There is a lady opposite to our house who is very poor. Her husband use to drink alcohol with all the money that he has earned from his work. He would not give money even for cooking. She had one son and three daughters. She herself was limping on her legs. He doesn’t even allow her to go out anywhere. If she goes out then the husband would show doubt on her saying that you are going out to do something bad. So he would not allow his wife to go out and they raise their children with lots of difficulty. She had three daughters and one son. Two daughters have got married and one daughter is still unmarried. The son has become 25 years old, but the son has learnt only whatever his father was doing.', 'Oh, He is like that only? Yes. The boy has turned out to be like that. He has started drinking alcohol and doing hooliganism and started beating also. Now he has brought one girl to the house.', 'Is it so? Yes, he brought her in the house by doing love marriage. But he may or may not earn. And that lady’s husband will drink alcohol and come home and beats his own wife. And then also he would eat everything and throw away the remaining food.', 'He throws away? Yes. He doesn’t allow others to eat and sometimes he even threw them out of house and then they had to stay overnight in houses of people like us. Now there is some peace but before there was lot of problem..', 'All the others are not like that know. No. All the others are not like that.', 'How about the other boys? The other boys go for education.', \"So they go for studying. Yes they study. They make them study till 10th and then put them on the job, if somebody's condition is like that. For some children they may put them on jobs like folding clothes in shops and all. But for some children, if they feel like they are studying well then they give them higher education. In our area there are boys who studies very well. Some has done computer engineering. There are boys who are educated.\", 'Okay. In every family who use to do exercises for 30 to 40 minutes per day? Nobody gets time to do exercises.', 'Nobody? No, nobody. If someone feels like that they will have problem in their body , then in the evening they will go out on the road to take a walk.', 'No one else like their children or their parents. No, but like how Meenakshi Ben said that we make the people do exercise in our center and some boys come there to do exercises.', 'Do you exercise? No . I don’t. But my son does exercises.', 'Does your son does? \\xa0But then he might be doing those bodybuilding kind of exercises. No. At the time of his birth, he was a stillborn child. Because I was married at the age of 16 years.', \"At such a small age? Yes, I got \\xa0married after giving the exam of 10th standard and they don't keep us at home. Also usually the girls are sent to their in laws after she becomes 18 or 20 years. But it was not so for me and I was send to the in laws immediately after the marriage. And so I had become pregnant with my son immediately after the marriage itself. And because he was born at a very young age of mine, he was a stillborn child .  Then 17 years back, my father had to spend a lot of money . Now \\xa0he is 17 years old. Therefore 17 years back my father had spent around 1 lakh rupees for his medicines.\", 'oh, okay! He was kept in that glass box for 15 days . And by giving one lakh rupees, \\xa0they had given us the stillborn baby alive. Right now he is going to college. He has grown up on medication up to 5 years. He hasn’t even got the breast milk. Because he was not that much healthy to be able to drink milk. He has grown up only on powder milk and medicines. He is also not that much tall, he is as tall as me. His body is also like mine. We have raised him with lot of difficulties. He had no life in him. But God has given him good intelligence, and so he is going to the college now.', 'That is very good. Another son of mine is in 10th standard now.', 'In 10th standard? Yes.', 'So you have 2 sons? Yes. I have two sons', 'So the elder one was on medicines till 5 years. Yes, The he was only on medicines. He was on medicines and we used to get the powder box and one such box of 500 grams will go on for only one week. We had to mix the powder in water and give him in every one hour or in every 15 to 20 minutes. Then as he grows then the 15 to 20 minutes has been increased to 20 to 25 minutes. Like that as he grows the gap has also been increased.', 'Oh, increased the gap like that. Yes.', 'Are people in your area where you are staying, are aware about that they have to do exercises? Or do they have liking to do exercise? No. Nobody is like that.', 'If someone is having a problem in their house, then whom do they go and confine to? Yeah they go and tell in their neighbors. Then if somebody needs help, then they help them also. But how they help is like suppose if I am having some problem then I come and tell that I am having this problem that my son is not well and I have no money, then that person would give me 1000 or 2000 rupees, but we have to tell that I will return it in 15 days or 1 month. Like that they help each other. They expect to return the money back.', 'Okay, it is like that. If there is any other kind of problems like stress between husband and wife, troubles because of children or in laws and then they cannot speak about those matters in the house itself. Then whom do they go and tell? Yes, they tell.', 'To whom do they talk to. They talk to neighbors or to the relatives that come to their house. It gives more advantage when they tell to relatives. Because of the relation they are having ,like suppose if he is a nephew or like that, then they are able to pressurize and tell to the other person like don’t do this thing, what you are doing is wrong, why you are troubling this lady or why your son is troubling this lady. This relatives can tell like that. \\xa0Whereas the neighbors may also tell but it will not be having that much effect. But if the relatives are been told, then they can check how the things are going on during their next visit. They would ask like whether he is troubling you now also or is there a peace now.  Like this the relatives can always tell.', 'Is anganwadi close to your house? No. It is little far, but not that much far. If we go out a little from here, then there is my anganwadi.', 'What kind of people are there in anganwadi? There also people are good.', 'They are also good people like the kind of people you told now. Yes, but there are 4 or 5 houses in the lower area where there is little bit of problems. They go to collect papers from the garbage. Sometimes they collect in the morning or sometimes they do that work whole night. In morning they separate the materials, then they sell it and have food with whatever money they had got out from selling that. There are 4 or 5 houses like that. And on the upper area there are well living people. They do labor or jobs. But they are normal people.', 'Children of both the kinds of people come to your anganwadi? Yes. Children of both come to our Anganwadi. Children from the well living house also come and children of the people with bad situations also comes to anganwadi.', \"If the people around your Anganwadi is having any problem do they talk about that in their neighborhood or do they come and talk to you? They come and tell us. They tell us that this is the situation. There was a lady at our place and her husband wouldn’t allow her to go to anywhere. If we call her for meeting, then she would say that “You have to ask my husband and I can come only when he allows”. Then when we explain to her husband, then he immediately sends her. But he doesn't allow her to go anywhere else.\", 'Do they share personal things to you? Yes, they tell us about their personal household matters.', 'Then do you go to help them? Yeah, we go to explain to them. But as we are helpers, we don’t go that much. As helpers, we have to call the children, clean the floors and make snacks. Our time goes in that. Whereas the worker ladies get more time. So when we are making the breakfast in the morning, they used to go for a round. At that time day come to know more about these things. They know about the situations in each house and they explain to them also. Then at the time when we leave the kids at around 2.00 or 2.30, \\xa0at that time also they have to go for house visits for 1 hour. So they know more about it, because when they are going for one hour they do all the inquiries.', 'When we consider the house of those children who comes here, who is the smarter or intelligent? Mostly mothers are very smart and intelligent.', 'That means ladies are more smart. Yes, ladies are smarter.', 'Is there any reason for that? May be because we do meetings with them and we explain to them lot of things like how much more attention you need to pay to the children, don’t allow them to eat outside food, then it is good for your children. And also we tell them to improve and imbibe good culture in your children. So they will pay attention and take care for that.', 'Who take more care for children? Mother.', 'Okay, mother. Yes, mother.', 'Do they take care? Yes, They are with us for 3 or 4 hours and the rest of the time their mother take care of them. Whereas fathers go for work in the morning and comes back as tired and so he goes to sleep. Even if mothers are going for work, after 2 to 3 hours she comes back. Those who are going for doing work in bungalows, they come back in 2 to 3 hours. And after coming back they are with children.', 'In a family who takes care the most? Parents take care, grandparents take care.', 'Do they take care? Yes, they do take care. And if they are having some money saved before, then they give that also. They don’t differentiate.', 'Do they give advice to each other in a house? Yes. They give advice.', 'What kind of advice do they give? What do they tell? Suppose co sisters have fought, then they ask why you are fighting like this and give advices like that you have to stay together for your whole life and should stay nicely with each other and if you are not staying nicely then relationship will be spoilt.', 'Will they listen to it? Yes they will listen.', 'Or do you need to force them? No, they will listen. Sometimes only if they are not understanding then they need to force them.', 'Do you remember of any such incidents happened? I told you about one incident about the alcoholic man opposite to our house know. He use to drink a lot, and trouble a lot in the house. We have seen that kind of incidents.', 'The person is not ready to listen now also, \\xa0right? Now he has improved a lot than before. There is a saying know that what the father is, \\xa0the children will be one and half times of that. Here exactly the same thing has happened. His son has proved that whatever the father was, \\xa0he is double than him.', 'Does he explains to his father? The father is scared of his son now. So when the father comes home by drinking alcohol, he use to sit in one corner.', 'Is it so? Yes, when the son comes home and if father has had alcohol, he will go and sit in one corner. Once the son goes out, he starts behaving badly. So father is scared of son.', 'Even son drinks alcohol? Yes. But son used to drink before and used to behave badly also. But after that he had brought a girl by doing love marriage and she had given him warning that if he is continuing this then she will not stay with him. So now he hides and drinks.', \"Are there any incidents happened like the person doesn't agree at all despite of the fact that you had explained him so much? Usually they listen to us. But when they are not listening then we will not go to them much again.\", 'Yes that is right. Do incidents like that they have disagreed, even after you had told them, has happened before? No, nobody is like that. They usually listen to us. But at that time they will agree, but afterwards they behave like whatever they were before. For example if there has occurred a fight and when we tell them to cool down then at that time there will be peace. But after sometime they will start fighting again.', 'Do they start again? Yes.', \"Do you have any idea about something that can be done to make them start listening? We try, but they don't agree.\", \"They don't listen at any cost. \\xa0Maybe that their thinking is different. Yeah, they think in different way. And if we try to tell them that not to do this way since it is not good, \\xa0then they will not listen. Someone might also say like you take care of your own house.  They use to say directly like that.\", 'Oh, they say like that. Yes, they say like “You take care of your own house”.', 'Is there anyone outside their family who is important for them? Yes, \\xa0like how Meenakshi Ben told when the madam comes then they treat her nicely by giving food, snacks and all.', 'No, not like that. Any well-wisher kind of a person. For example you have your neighbor and when you approach them for something you have that much trust on them that for whatever you ask your neighbor they will tell only good to you, and they will not put you into any losses or trouble. So that person is your well-wisher. And so that if you have any problem then you would go and ask that person. So like that do the people in the area of anganwadi have any well-wishers? About that only Bharti Ben will know.', \"Bharti Ben only know, you don't have any idea. No, I don’t know.\", 'Bharti Ben is the teacher who is with you, right? Yes, she is the teacher and I am her helper. She is on leave right now.', 'No problem. Is there anyone to whom they will never say no to? No.', 'So they use to refuse directly itself. If something is needed to be told to someone, then Bharti Ben is kind of a person who would tell things immediately to them, even if the person feels bad. She doesn’t care about whether the person calls or doesn’t call afterwards. If some advice is needed to be given to a person, then she will definitely tell that “See, this is not good”, “This is the right thing” or “Why are you doing wrong thing” .There was a lady in our area whose husband has got sick and he was given blood from which he has got HIV. At first husband got affected, then when they checked for children, thankfully they were not HIV positive. His medication is going on. \\xa0They have two sons and one daughter. But their condition is very bad. They are getting food to eat by doing labor. He got HIV through blood transfusion. At first one person got and now his wife also got it. So now two people in a house is having HIV. By luck only the children has not got HIV. So at some place this kind of conditions are there.', 'Do they have anybody here to whom they would not be able to say no? Like how when I came to ask for help, you had never said no to me. Like that is there anybody over here to whom you will never say no and tell them that you have work ,so come and we can do it? See, if somebody have some work then they will help even if it is small. They will help out each other.', 'Would everybody do that for each other? No one will say no to anyone. No, they will help. If there is any ceremony or something like that, then the neighbor people will come and help. They may do cooking also. If the is occurring a big celebration and there is hardly two or three people, \\xa0then they will not be able to manage themselves. So then people from neighborhood will come and help. We also use to go to their house and help them. We use to take care of their ceremonies and will help them also.', 'If there is any financial problem, then do they give money? Yes. They will give. I told you know like if there is monetary problem, they would give money if we are giving promise of one or two months. But then it has to be returned whenever that person has money.', 'No, \\xa0that is near your area. I am asking about anganwadi. Yes, here in our area also it is like that.', 'Do people eat sugar? Meenakshi Ben told know that they use to eat very less of sweets. They eat more of spicy and fried food. They drink a lot of tea, \\xa0so the sugar is used in that.', 'They drink lot of tea. Yes.', 'Do they know that if we leave sugar, then it is good for our body? Yes. they know.', 'Do they know? They know. But they don’t take it seriously.', 'How about reducing the quantity? No, They don’t reduce the quantity also. How much ever tea they are drinking, that much tea they will drink.', 'Do they use sugar only in tea and nothing else? No not anything else. Only in tea.', 'Than do they eat spicy food? They eat more spicy and fried foods.', 'So they eat fried food also. Yes, Meenakshi Ben told know that in Sabji also there will be more of oil and spices.', 'Is it same in her and your area? Yes. It is same. In our area near to this side in Kumbhar Vas where the potter community stay, all are prosperous. They have their own business.', 'Yes, potter communities have their own business. Some people even do job, but overall they are in a better position.', \"They don't have any monetary problem. No monetary problems.\", 'Would they leave such habits once doctor advises? Only those who understands may leave and others may not leave.', 'But such people are very few, know. Rest of them don’t even agree. Yeah they don’t agree and they don’t listen to doctor.', 'Will they avoid salt if doctor say? No. they will not leave.', 'Will they decide on their own? No, they have eaten salt for every day. Then they would not like the taste of bland food. They will not think like since the doctor has advised it will be good for my health and will benefit me. No, they will not think like that.', 'So he will just keep listening to whatever doctor is saying, and passes it through the other ear. Yes, it is like that.', 'Do they take all medicines or they leave in between? If they feel alright, then they leave. Recently we gave TB medicines to 10 to 20 people.', 'You did that. Yes. We help them to cure TB completely. When it is in my hands, it has never happened like the TB has not got cured. Since I have work to do and need to come to anganwadi in the morning, I myself go to their house and give them medicine in evening. Those persons could be gents, ladies, old lady or uncle. I give them medicine myself and once they consume it, then only I use to go home. It is a course of 6 months.', 'Do they complete the course? I make them complete.', 'Do you make them complete the course? Yes, I make them complete the course.', 'Suppose you have not \\xa0gone to give the medicine, then? No, I would give medicine to everybody and explain to them on my own that “ If you give it up on half way, then you will fall into more trouble, then you might need to take the course and injection for 2 years. Now it is the initial stage of TB and so if you are taking the medicine and completing the course then it will get cured.” Then they have medicine.', 'So that is because of you. Other than TB, suppose if they are going to consult doctor for some other diseases and he had prescribed some medicine for one month. Then if he becomes alright, then will they complete the course for that or not? yes. They might leave the course. But only few people do that.', 'If you have skin problem, the medication goes for 1 or 2 months, so will they complete the course? Yeah, there \\xa0are some people like that.', 'Will they leave? Yes,  they will leave.', 'Is like that only few people are there or many are there? Only few people like that.', \"Will the rest of them complete the course? But they don't have that kind of problems know. Only few people might have that kind of problem. They would think like “ ok doctor will keep saying”. \\xa0But like that hardly 10 or 20 percent people will only be there. Some will take medicine and some will not be having any problem.\", \"Not like that. For example, if you have any skin problem like boils then the medication need to be continued for long time like 1 or 2 months. But after 15 days the boils smooth out. Then will they stop or will they be completing the course for 2 months? That is what I'm asking. So if they are leaving it in halfway, then again maybe they will get boils back. But \\xa0I told you know there are some people who  would leave in between. If the people are like us, \\xa0then we would complete the course.\", 'Do they take decision by themselves? Like suppose by watching programmes in TV or from the drama conducted by people like you, if they get some knowledge and understand or learn something good like we should not do a particular thing, then will they decide on their own like from today onwards we will not do that particular thing ? When they see it newly they decide that ”Okay , we will not do it anymore”. But then afterwards when they go back to their home, in 2 to 3 days they return back to the same routine.', 'So they cannot continue doing it. Yes, they cannot continue.', 'Do the people near your anganwadi thinks like that it is good to do exercises or it is beneficiary for the body? Do they believe like that? Yes. But they don’t take it seriously.', \"Yes, they don't take it seriously. But do they know about it? Yes, they know that if we are doing exercise then it is good for the body. But nobody is doing.\", 'What stops them ? They don’t have time.', \"Oh, They don't have time. No time.\", 'Is that because of any other reason? No, there is no other reason. There is no time.', 'How about laziness? Some people are lazy. But mostly they have no time. They say like ”What is the need, \\xa0let it be like that”.', 'Suppose when a lady like you know and advise them, \\xa0then will they do? Yes. They will do for 1 week, then it will be back to the same.', 'Do you go and check afterwards? Yes. The worker madam goes.', 'Okay, Do the worker sister goes just to check whether they are continuing or not? Yes, she goes.', 'Have you ever thought about any ways for encouraging them? Bharti Ben will do such things. If there is something that is needed to be told to them, \\xa0then she would tell like that “If you are doing these things then it will be good for you”. People in our area is little scared of Bharti Ben.', \"They are scared of her? Yes. They think that if they don't do, then Bharti Ben will tell something to them. So they do work for some time.\", 'It shows respect for her. Yes.', 'Do you have any idea of diabetes? Yes. Meenakshi Ben told you know that we had a camp for diabetes over here. I know that if we got diabetes, then if we are getting hurt then it will not get cured easily and sometimes the whole area becomes black like how it becomes black when a vein is getting blocked and it may cause to cut the affected toe or leg. Also sometimes it might cause paralysis. The person feels hungry and thirsty very frequently. Meenakshi Ben told know. Our Bharti Ben has diabetes.', 'Does she have diabetes? Yes, she has diabetes. She came to know recently once she checked it during the camp . Before that it was not there. When Bharti Ben has met with an accident, then she got hurt. She had gone through lot of kinds of medication.', 'Do you or the parents of the kids in anganwadi have any idea about how diabetes happens? We don’t know how it happens. But one thing we came to know that is it is hereditary. If parents got it, it goes to children also. We don’t know if there is any other reason.', 'Like if you eat too much sugar, it can happen. Yes. If we eat too much sugar, we can get diabetes.', 'If a person has diabetes, he should control sweets, do they know that? Yes. They know they have to have tea without sugar or should not eat sweets. These things they know.', 'Do they know which part of the body gets affected? I told you the person may get the attack of paralysis.', 'No. Not like that. Which part of the body gets affected? I don’t know that.', 'They also may not be knowing.? They also may not be knowing. They eat rice, potato, or kichdi.', 'Do they know how to keep curtailment? Yes. That they know.', 'How many houses are covered by your anganwadi. Is it 200? Yes. 200 are covered .', 'So in that approximately how many people might be having diabetes? 2 or 3 people got diabetes. I told you know about one old lady. I know that lady, Bharti Ben and one more lady. I know of those 2,3 ladies.', 'Does Bharti Ben stay here only ? Yes. She stays here only. Her house is as far as like anganwadi is from Manav Sadhna and my house is bit farther.', 'Your house is still far? Yes.', 'Do you have phone ? Yes.', 'In that area how many people might be having phone? Does each person have phone? Yes. Meenakshi Ben told you know that everyone in a house has phone.', 'I thought she was talking about her anganwadi area. I am asking about your anganwadi. In our Karuna anganwadi area also, everyone has a phone. At least 2 or 3 phones in every house.', '2 or 3 phones? Yes. One for father, one for mother and one extra they keep at home with children. Like that 3 phones will definitely be there.', 'What type of phones do they use? Do they use touch-screen phone as what you have? touch-screen hardly they use. Mostly other ones.', 'button-phones? Yes. Button pressing phones. Some people have those china made touch-screen phones.', 'How about the landline boxes with wire? No. they don’t have those phones. Earlier they used to have.', 'Now it’s not there? No. now it’s not there.', 'What kind of phones are used mostly? Those press button-phones. Hardly anyone keeps touch-screen phones. Only the children keep those phone.', 'What is the usage of phones for them? They use phones to talk to and send messages.', 'Do they send messages? Yes. They send messages, play games, listen to songs. But mostly they use it for talking.', 'How about the children? Are they very young? Is that why they still don’t have phones? No. There are some children who are 20 to 25 years old also. In our area of 200 houses, there are 30 to 35 boys who are 20 to 25 years old. And the rest are very small.', 'So the small kids will not have phones? No. Small kids will not have phones. Suppose they are 15 or 20 years old, then they will have phones.', 'What is the usage of phone for those kids? They use it for talking only. If they are going school, then they would call parents and inform. Like wise if parents are out, then they would call kids and inform. They inform like that I will be delayed or are going somewhere outside. They use phone like this.', 'Do they use alarm? Yes. They use alarm.', 'How about videos and internet?

They say like even if I work so much, my mother-in-law taunts me. But the other person cannot solve it by talking to the mother-in-law.

Different areas. Hers is known as Vanchara Vas and mine is known as Gandhari Jari.', 'Yes. Hers was entirely different. Yes.

Yes. 12 number anganwadi where there is Varsha Ben and Madhu Ben.', 'Yes. She was telling me. But yours is very good right? Yes. In our side it is good. Many people there do jobs at many places. Many of them give education to girls as well as boys. And it is not like that the girls are not sent for studying, but all children are studying. And people are fashionable also. They are living in normal way. At some places like Vadyari Vas and Vanchara Vas, the condition is like this where everyone is doing labor only. In the morning they do labour, in the afternoon they collect recyclable materials from garbage and separate it and they come home after getting the money. In many houses it is like they get daily food by doing those labor. It is like how Meenakshi Ben told. They eat chilli and roti or in some house they just have tea and roti and they sleep. In many houses it is like if wife has got money , husband will beat her and take the money. They drink alcohol and comes home. It is like these only.', 'Don’t ladies take care? No. not at all.', 'Why so? At some places it is also because of the ladies. If you want your husband to be good, then it is also in the hands of ladies.', 'Yes. That’s true. If she doesn’t want him to be changed, then they will say like let him do what he wants to do and I will do what I want. Then the husband will not improve or change. So he will continue beating as he was doing. Also those who don’t want to improve will not improve.', 'Why do ladies behave like this? They say let him do whatever he wants to do and I will do whatever I want to do. Every 2 to 3 days he is getting spoilt and they continue beating his wife. There are also many husbands who take care of their wives.', 'Is that so? Yes. They look after them and sometimes if they had alcohol, then they beat their wives.', 'Doesn’t the wife leave him? If she went away, who will look after kids?', 'She can go by taking the kids. Suppose if I went with my kids, my brother and sister-in-law will not look after me. Right? My brother, sister-in-law and parents would be there. They are hardly managing themselves. Then if I go and stay over there, then how can they manage me and my kids. So whatever is going on, we have to leave it in its own way. At some places, in Vanchara Vas and Vadyari Vas, some ladies have also made their husbands improve. They have become good people after listening to their wives telling things like “This may not be good for our children, tomorrow our children will grow up and they might have problems, they may be able to get engaged. So you leave all these things.  ”. And also like how you said, the relatives also explains to him when they are been told about their problems. Then when the opposite person understands that these people are trying to help, then sometimes some men change or improve also. Some doesn’t even listen and change. Suppose if someone is soft hearted, then they would improve. Whereas some don’t change at all. They don’t want to be changed. Like suppose if I am having a husband who roam around after having alcohol and I am going out to do some wrong things, then my husband will definitely get informed about this, then I will have problem. So if I am trying to improve him, he understands. Like that if I am trying to spoil him, then also he understands that. So he keeps his mind closed. In many cases it has happened like that also.', 'Is there any ladies over here doing wrong things? Yes. There are some like that.', 'Everyone wants everything free. Right? Yes. Everyone wants everything free. Nowadays these are what going on.', 'How about the men keep drinking alcohol and just sleeping. Where do they earn from?

Those were given to many people and they are running those.', 'You spoke about ladies who doesn’t want their husbands to be improved. How do they earn money? They go for work without informing their husbands. They go for house cleaning works.', 'You just now said that they do wrong works. What wrong works they do? See there are some ladies like that.', 'Is there? Yes.', 'How about their kids? Do they also turn out to be bad? Whatever manners are taught , they learn that.', 'They also get spoiled seeing their parents? Yes. By seeing their parents they also get spoiled.

The reason maybe the parents don't have time from their work. They don't come out of their work and and they cannot take care of their children. So they keep playing whole day or roaming around. So they fail and once they fail there at home. They are not interested in studying.\", \"They don't have interest in studying? No, they are not interested in studying.\", \"Do they listen to their parents? If they listen, \\xa0then parents will make them to study. \\xa0But they don't even listen. They say they don't want to study. Then what to do.\", \"Do their father and mother tell them to study? \\xa0Or are they also not interested to make them studying ? Parents used to tell. \\xa0Parents sometimes beat them also. But don't go. What to do.\", \"Yes, \\xa0that is true. There are some like that. \\xa0When we go to explain to them,  we explain to the girls also here, when there is the girls’ meeting. But here, \\xa0the area is such that there are many incidents happening. So then they don't send the girls for studying.\", \"Don't they send girls for studying? No they don't send them for studying.\", \"So here is there any problem or trouble of that kind? This area is such that everyone is not the same. And everyone cares a lot about their prestige. And they are uneducated, \\xa0so they don't understand. Now the girls who are not studying and  are uneducated,  how do they stay. And these elder people don't understand such things. So they don't send the girls outside. We explain to them everything, when the girls come for their meeting. We explain to them everything like to respect their parents and do as what parents say. We conduct meeting of adolescence girls every Saturday. Then we give them would advices. Because parents are uneducated and so they will not be having any knowledge.\", \"Is it like the parents only tells from the house to the girls that not to go for studying ? Yes, \\xa0parents only say them to not to go. They don't send. \\xa0They will say like there are work and so you do the work. The study little bit and after that they make them do the household work. For the girls it is done this way.\", \"Not for earning money from outside. No, \\xa0not for earning money from outside. They make them do household work. They don't send girls for doing outside work also. Nobody sends.\", \"So they keep them at home for doing household work only? Yes, \\xa0for doing household work. Also they haven't studied much, \\xa0like they had studied till 6th or 7th or 8th or 9th, and then they make them sit at home. They make them do household work and get them married at a very young age.\", 'Oh, So they get married at young age. Still they are doing like that? Yes, \\xa0they are doing like that now also.', 'So here the one who is getting married, \\xa0what is the age of that girl? She is almost 18 to 19 years old. She is quite big.', 'Like in the house if she is feeling some problem, \\xa0then to whom she will go and tell? Yes, \\xa0there sometimes problems happen. They go to dispensary or sometimes to us when we go there if they are having problem. See we have the Raman Bhai over here know. If they are having some problem then we contact those people, they come and take them.', 'So that means they tell you. Yes, we roam in the entire area. We have to visit them at least once in a day, in the area. So if anybody have any trouble, then we tell them from our side. Like if there is a child, \\xa0and the child is not well because of high temperature. So for the health of the children, in private they do it for free or with less expenditure.', 'No, \\xa0no I am not asking about the disease. \\xa0Sometimes there will be problems occurring in the house, like girls have problem, children have problem or small children have problem. Sometimes they will be problems between husband and wife. Also there will be some things that they cannot say in the house. Yeah, \\xa0they cannot say in the house.', 'Then to whom do they go and tell? Here there are lot of fighting happening in the house.', 'What are the reason for such fights? They keep fighting for small things. For us if there is occurring any problem in the house, we resolve it internally. But here they inform everybody outside.', 'Is it so? Here this kind of things are there. They make mountain out of small issues.', 'So they make it very big. Yes, \\xa0even if there is nothing in that, \\xa0they do like that.', \"Don't they resolve it by talking? No they do not resolve. \\xa0It is like that only.\", 'If there is a fight between husband and wife, \\xa0that also happens like that? Yes, \\xa0the husband and wife also fight like that. The husband will drink alcohol and come at night, \\xa0then what the poor wife will do. Whatever they are earning, they finish it in alcohol. Then how about wife and children. It is like this over here right now. Whatever they earn, they finish it in drinking alcohol. They hardly give anything in the house. Then what do the ladies do. It is that kind of situation right now.', 'So is there the addiction of alcohol too much over here? Yes, here the addiction of alcohol is too much. If drinking alcohol is stopped \\xa0or the place where the alcohol is selled is closed, then this will stop.', 'Then they will get it from somewhere else. Not like that. \\xa0It should be banned, so there will be no alcohol available. \\xa0Then from where they will get it then.', \"Yes, \\xa0that is true. But government is taking profit and all these things are going on. So poor remains poor only. Because whatever they are earning, they are using it for drinking alcohol. And the condition of poor wife and children remain the same. They don't even get food eat. \\xa0And that is the situation of these poor people.\", 'So there is a problem of food also. Yes, \\xa0there will be problem for food, \\xa0also he beats and we cannot tell them anything. Because when they drink alcohol and come, \\xa0we cannot speak to them anything.', 'How much do they earn per day? They earn around 200 or 300 per day.', \"And they drink alcohol for those 200 or 300 rupees? Yes, \\xa0almost half goes in drinking \\xa0and then they don't give anything in the house. So there will be fight in the house.\", 'Then how does the house run? What will they do. \\xa0Poor ladies,  they do the work. They do all job.', 'Then how much do those ladies earn? They earn around 100 or 200 for running the household.', 'Oh, They earn around 100 or 200. Yes.', 'Then in every house, \\xa0who is more smart? The ladies are smart.', 'Ladies Only? Yes, Ladies are only smarter. \\xa0Gents do not care for the house. Ladies are smart.', 'Is the relationship between children and mother is good? Yes, \\xa0their relationship is good.', 'Do they take care of their children? Or since there are 5 to 6 kids will they feel like to let them roam about? No, \\xa0they take care of their children. If they have the feeling to make them as good people, then they take care. And so the children become cultured. And some are like, \\xa0they leave their children and allow them to roam.', 'Then how many people are such culture people? Suppose we are considering the population as 100%, then out of them 50 or 60% will be good. And the rest half will be just like that only.', \"So is it like they leave them because they don't understand anything or they don't have any idea about that? Or is it because they get fed up and leave them? They have no knowledge. Only the children are grown up, \\xa0and that is only our responsibility and nothing else. See we know that when we give proper education for our children, \\xa0they get good job. We had suffered so much and nowadays there is so much of inflation. Then if they are getting education and good job and come forward, \\xa0then they can earn sufficiently for themselves. We know that,  but there are very few others who understands that..\", 'They don’t understand. Is it for that purpose you are going to visit them? Why do you go and visit them ? We have to go to call these kids. If they have not come, then we have to go and call them. We must go there in those areas after finishing our work. And if the child is small, then in the afternoon we have to go to drop them also.', 'So you have to go to drop them also? Yes. So \\xa0we have to make 2 to 3 rounds in our area everyday.', 'Then some children will be there who will not be listening to their parents \\xa0or when you give advice to them do they listen? We explain to them. \\xa0In many areas we explain to the boys and girls that you must study, \\xa0so that you will have a bright future. We explain to them like that.  There are many who have improved nowadays. \\xa0Before there was lot of unemployment and they were uneducated. Now they have understood about how children get job by studying. So they give education to children. The pay fee and make them study. Before they were not giving education. Even they would not send their children to municipality. Now they pay the fee and give them education for their children.', 'So it has improved now. Yes, \\xa0recently it has improved.', 'There are such small things like not to go outside in the night. \\xa0Do parents give advice to their children regarding this ? And do children listen to them? Yes they listen to it.', \"What kind of advices do parents give? You know about the situation that is prevailing outside. \\xa0Even when nobody says anything,  the fighting happens, police case happens. All are not same. When we go out and if a person is under the influence of alcohol, \\xa0then if we don't say anything itself, they fight. So they explain in this way that you cannot go out. I explain to my children that you should not roam outside.\", 'Then do they listen to you? Yes, \\xa0they listen. \\xa0My children listen.', 'Do you have to force them? No, \\xa0my children listen to it.', 'Suppose they are studying in the school and from the school they are going for a trip to somewhere. Then when they come home and tell you about this and if due to some reason you are refusing to send them for the trip, then do they listen to you or throw tantrums. No, \\xa0they listen to me. \\xa0Considering my situation whatever I had told them they had listened to that. Our situation was like that. \\xa0My children are very understanding.', 'Your children are understanding. Yes, \\xa0all the three.', \"How about everybody else? Is it so that the children are adamant? Yes, \\xa0there  are many. \\xa0In our neighbor itself \\xa0there are three sons, one was drinking alcohol. So he used to get water in the liver. Then he died also. The second one also keeps drinking alcohol. Even though his brother had expired, he is not improving. They don't listen to their parents, \\xa0since the parents leave them right from the beginning itself know. Here all like that.  Nobody listens. We have to control them right from the beginning. When they are young in what way we are molding them they will mold.\", 'Yes, \\xa0afterwards they will not change. Yes, \\xa0we need to be them also, \\xa0we need to shout at them also. So that they are little scared. So I have kept the control right from the beginning. Because their father was like he would drink and eat non vegetarian food. So I had suffered a lot with the father of my children. Then the girls who might get married into my house also will suffer. \\xa0Her life also would get spoilt if I am not taking care. I were told like that I have to bear everything and I stayed. But nowadays nobody will bear.', 'Yes, \\xa0nobody will bear. So I had kept control on my children right from the beginning. \\xa0I had beaten them also. My elder son is there,  even if I beat him, he will not say anything in front of me.', 'You have control of you kids. Yes, \\xa0because in the beginning their father earn money and give in the house or may not give in the house. But children do hard work and do support also. They say like “ You are our mother know”.', \"Yeah, \\xa0yeah that's true. I had suffered a lot because he used to drink alcohol and eat non vegetarian food. So at first he spent everything for drinking alcohol and eating non vegetarian food. Then he became physically sick. I had good number of children so after that I had worked a lot. So I had suffered. \\xa0And therefore I need my children to get good education. So that they will get good future.\", 'Has he stopped drinking alcohol now? Yes, \\xa0after he become physically sick, he has stopped drinking alcohol. When he was physically good itself we used to tell him. But he never used to listen to us. But when it came to his own health and he got hurt in the walk of life then he left. But still the way he is talking and the mannerism is the same. What can we do.', 'Yeah, \\xa0the nature of a person will not change immediately. Yes, \\xa0by nature they are only showing frustration.', 'Do you have somebody important person outside your family? Important person means.', 'Important means if you are having some worries you can go and talk to that person. Or if you are in need of money, then you can take from them privately. After coming to Anganwadi, \\xa0all the ladies here support in a nice way. If there is any problem then they support each other.', 'So is that the working lady who is with you? Yes, \\xa0that worker lady and also there is Nita Ben know. So sometimes if we tell them when we need money, they will help. She had given me money like that once. Yes, \\xa0so they give if we need money.', \"Ok, \\xa0but sometimes there happens some problems like we cannot tell them to husband or children, so whom do you talk to just open your heart. Initially I suffered a lot. The situation was such that I could not tell anything to anybody. But now the children take care. They see know. \\xa0When their father tell something they say to me like ” Mother you don't say anything”. They only deal with their father.\", 'Yes, \\xa0the children had grown up and started understanding. Yes.', \"Then how about the other ladies who come to anganwadi? Whether they talk to you or to the teacher or is there anybody else ? Yes, \\xa0they come.  We tell them to not to bear wrong things and do hard work. Whatever is the situation, \\xa0if we are not doing anything wrong you don't have to bear anything wrong. Don't depend on your husband. \\xa0If they are good,  they are earning and giving the money, it is okay. Otherwise you can go out.  Here there is so many controls over them. They don't allow them to go out. \\xa0Even I was not allowed to go out. But then I fought  and I am doing this job since 10 to 11 years. Before they were not allowing me to do the job also. So I always tell them that you should go out, then you will get knowledge.\", 'Yes, \\xa0so true. Yes, \\xa0we learn so many things. If we are sitting just inside the house, \\xa0then how will we have knowledge or information.When we talk to people outside, \\xa0we get knowledge. So because of the reason that I came out I reached here.', 'Do other ladies come to talk to you? Yes, \\xa0they come.  We are like family only. We talk our sorrows to each other. Because it has been 5 to 6 years, so we talk to each other like our own sisters. And we always give good advice.', 'And if you are having some trouble then will you talk to them only or you have somebody else to talk to? No we also talk to them about our sorrows about how much we suffered. So you try to bear and do hard work. Then God will take care of you. \\xa0We give them advice like this.', 'Ok, \\xa0also is there somebody around you or near you, \\xa0like if you tell something to that person, they will not say no to you for anything and that person will always keep the respect. Yes, they are there.', 'Who is that person? Here all the ladies are there. My younger brother-in-law is also there. \\xa0He also jumps to help me. I have suffered so much.  But my younger brother-in-law and elder brother-in-law always respect me. I have 5 to 6 co-sisters, \\xa0who are younger and elder, and they all tell me that I understand things very wisely.', \"They don't refuse to you for anything? No, \\xa0they don't refuse to me for anything.\", 'And who is the person to whom you will not say no for anything. Whoever is there in my neighborhood, comes and ask me that I need something, then I never say no to anybody.', \"You also don't refuse. No I don't \\xa0refuse.\", \"If somebody need some help, then you don't refuse. No I don't refuse. If somebody in my neighborhood does not have something or they need something, then I don't refuse. \\xa0Right from the beginning I have that nature.Everybody comes and tell me,  even if they wanted to buy something. The youngest daughter in my neighborhood like to stay with me when I go back. Then her mother also, \\xa0even if she wanted to buy something,  she asks me.\", 'Yes, \\xa0you have been going out for so many years. So they also understand that you have more knowledge and more understanding than them. Yes, \\xa0so if there is anything they will ask me only.', 'Okay, Do people have bank account over here? Yes, \\xa0in between this Jan Dhan Yojana has come up know. \\xa0So all the ladies have account over there with zero balance. Then here there is Shakti Mandal that is going on. Or there are other institutions that is going on. So in that they have account and they will deposit like 100 rupees monthly. There is an institution going on in Manav Sadhna also. So they deposit monthly hundred rupees in that and save.', 'So they save right and how many such people will be there? There are a lot. All the ladies are definitely doing it with 100 rupees. They were not doing it before. But now it is like, yearly whatever is deposited, along with the interest they get it back.', 'So now you are saying about ladies. \\xa0Those ladies are from where? Are they from this Paryavaran Mitra? From Paryavaran and those who stay in this surrounding area. All those.', \"Do they take insurance? We have taken insurance because we came to know this time. But these ladies don't understand what insurance is. See the man has not left anything for us. \\xa0So we explain to them that when something happens to your husband suddenly, then if there is insurance then it helps a lot. So like that we explain to them.\", 'So you talk to them about life insurance. Yes, \\xa0about life insurance. There is Raman Bhai here, who do this kind of work of insurance. So we have got insurance. \\xa0And also all the ladies have done the insurance.', 'Are those \\xa0ladies from Paryavaran or Anganwadi ladies? Mostly Anganwadi ladies.', 'Those Paryavaran ladies have not done? In Paryavaran it has been there for hardly 6 months. It is very new, \\xa0not old.', \"So those ladies have not done the insurance?

Then how will they be able to give tea to the guests. Yes, but they don't understand that. If a guest has come, then we will have to go and bring them, we will have to give them gifts and do things for them even if we have to take loans for that. So even by taking loans, we have to do hospitality for them. Sometimes if there is occurring some ceremony, then also we will have to go there even by taking loans. It is like that in our community.\", 'What is the reason for that? The reason can be that there are old people in the community and they keep doing things like this and the rest wants to follow it.

I have completed graduation in English medium.\", \"Oh, really. Yes, \\xa0I had done graduation. So \\xa0if I am doing any job outside, \\xa0then easily I would be getting salary of 10 or 11 thousand easily. But here I had joined for a salary of only 2500. My mother's house was very near to Gandhi Ashram of nearly 5 minutes distance and no need of transportation. I thought like I had got an opportunity to do service for the people and so I have accepted the offer with whatever they gave. After joining here I had got many opportunities to do service for the people. We had provided service when there was flood in Uttarakhand. We were there for 15 to 20 days and helped them. So we got such lot of opportunities to do service for people. My husband is being attached with the institution for 15 to 20 years right from his childhood. So we got opportunities to work together. There is a new project in this center that is been started for one year.\", 'Yes. Aashiq Bhai brought it know. Yes. Now it is been 6 months since it started. But the background works, like survey, \\xa0checking how the ladies are managing or how could we help them, were going on for the last one year. We used to take care of such small or big things right from the beginning. We used to go for surveys for ladies for understanding how could we be helpful to them. So we did a lot of work like that. Ashiq Bhai also did lot of survey. There is a one institute called Swachh in Pune which is doing same kind of work. We have visited that place for one week. But there it was different and here it is a little bit different.', 'Yes, when the places change then there will be little bit difference. The job of collecting garbage which is being done by the ladies there, is not been done by the KMC people. They get the salary also from there and the flats that they have to go are also decided. They have to go in so many houses in the area where they stay. They collect the garbage from those area.', 'Are they going door to door and collecting the garbage ? Yes they go door to door and collect the garbage.', \"Does government give them anything? The government gives them things like handcart or pedal rickshaw. So they don't have to go by walking. They also provide things like dustbins, hand coat, gloves and all. They have that coat of Swachh. They provide these things. There are also some wet garbage like vegetables which doesn't get recycled. So this ladies need to pick those garbage \\xa0and doesn't pick plastic bags, bottles, etc. So this ladies do that kind of work. We came to know lot of things after going there. After coming here I started doing whatever I can do for these ladies.\", 'So you must have visited all the houses around this area. You are permitted by the committee, right? Yes.', 'What is the average size of the family over here in one house? Those who are of age 18 to 20 years old will have one child or two children like one son or a daughter. Those who are above the age of 35 to 40 will have around three or more children like three sons and two daughters. So like that they might have for 4 to 5 kids. In laws might also stay together. So they have large families. Hardly there are any families who are small.', 'Approximately how many people are there of 18 years old and of 35 years old? Here the small age girls of 18 to 20 years old, who have come here after being got married, know that it in their houses the work of collecting papers from garbage are going on. So they also have to go for that. If they cannot go out since they have come from a good family and feel shy doing that work, then they would do the work of sorting those materials at home. And the in laws will go out for collecting the materials like papers and all from the garbage. So like that they share the work. So there is hardly 10 to 15 percentage of ladies who are around 18 to 20 years old. Rest all are above 30 or 40 years.', 'Do they stay together? Yes, they stay together.', 'Isn’t it that they stay separate or like that? No, they stay together.', 'That means in one house itself will be 6 to 7 people staying together. Yes, in one house itself, there will be 7 to 8 people for sure. Also in those houses the condition is like the husband would not be earning and drinks alcohol or sometimes they do gambling.', 'Still also it is there. Yes, that is still going on here mostly. And always you can see that they will be sitting in some or the other corner. You can see the gambling going on the whole day, not only in the night.', 'Only the ladies earn. Yeah, mostly the ladies only earn. Also if the men are feeling like that they can do, they are not properly educated. So they do labor only. Many of them have handcart and tempo which we call as three wheeler. So mostly they do those around only like taking luggage from one place to the other or if someone wants to send something from one place to the other. So by doing these they earn around 150 to 200 rupees for one round. If the place is very nearby then they will be getting only 50 rupees. If it is quite far then they will be getting around 200 rupees. They live their life like this only.', 'Here before Ranip there is Wadhwa Nagar. Over there in the morning a lot of labor people use to stand. Yes.', 'Those people are not from here. Those people are doing masonry work.', \"Where do they come from? They are from this community only. \\xa0They don't know any other work and they are also on labor. My father-in-law also do this work only. He goes for construction work. For them one place is decided where everyone gathers and from there the contractor comes and take to the site. He knows about which one can do which work. Then after that they will leave them back at the same place in the evening and give the labor charges for the day.\", 'So the work is done on the daily basis or on the hourly basis. Daily basis. They go in the morning and come back in the evening.', 'Not like that. I am asking whether the payment is given on daily basis or hourly basis. No, they get payment for the full day.', 'Approximately what is that amount? It is 300 rupees per day for those who are doing labor work. And for craftsman, who knows how to take measurements, who knows everything and orders everything, gets 700 rupees as labor charge per day.', 'Do they this craftsmanship? No, they don’t know. They can do masonry work, but in such a big community there are hardly 5 to 7 people who do these work. They also feel lazy doing that work as well.', 'They don’t want to work. No, they don’t want to work.', 'But so much of public was there, then where are the others. Where do they come from? Do you have any idea? Because when you come in the morning there are so many people standing there. When you get down from Gangeshwar to here, there is Dandi Bridge. Then there is the Silver Cloud building near to which there is an area called Khadol. The majority of people in that area do the plumbing and construction work only. So all those people would go there. If you go little ahead from there, in Vadaj also there is a big community who do this work.  In the whole Tekra area there is staying about 8000 to 9000 people who do this work. Also if you cross the road from there to the opposite side, there also the population is of this kind only. It is all labor, but not luxury area. So everybody does this work only.', \"So does this community center over here do service for the entire public or is it like only for this many people? No, it is open for everyone. But it is far for some people. Here the atmosphere is like that they don't allow girls to go out that much since many people are roaming around on the streets by drinking alcohol. Sometime\\xa0they tease also. So they won't allow the girls or ladies to go out that much. But still the teachers here in the community center would go out and explain to their parents and convince them to send their children to the community center for studying. Right now the exams are over and the results are also out. So lot of people have understood now and will send them to us. Those who don't want to educate their children will not send them also.\", 'So there is still the fear of that kind. Yes. Boys do come but girls will study tell 5th, 6th or 7th standard and sit at home.', \"Don't they study further? No they don't study. \\xa0We are trying that much to make them come.\", 'Will you go home and explain to them? Yes, \\xa0we also explain to the ladies who come to our place. We use to ask them how many children do you have, what do they do, \\xa0what do they study. Right now many of the girls had left their studies after the 5th standard.', \"What is the reason? \\xa0Is that the fear is the reason? They themselves don't want to study and also parents force them to help for doing their work in the house.\", 'Is it for getting the income? Not in getting the income. \\xa0They need to help them in doing the household work, like if mother goes out to collect the road side waste then who will do the cooking at home, who will take care of their younger brothers or sisters . So 5th or 6th standard girls would do this work.', 'So then they stop their studies. Yes.', 'So in one house there is at least  6 or 7 public staying like grandparents, parents and children? Yes.', 'There is no problem for boys to study. They come right? Yes. Boys come. There are some parents who are very sincere and they think even if they are doing labor, their children should study.', 'But those kind of people are very few, right? There are many ladies who put their children in private school also. I think there is only 10 percent who doesn’t do that.', 'Do they have that much income to afford their kids studying in a private school? Those who do rag picking ,if both husband and wife are going then they earn around 500 to 600 per day.', 'Is that earned individually or combining both? Combining both. They earn 500 rupees because they do sorting from garbage., then they get plastic spoons, water bottles, card boards etc. So each of them have different quality and for different quality have different rates. They get all the garbage for free, they just have to pick, separate it and they get different rate for each and every thing got from that.', 'So per day 600 means, they get 18000 to 20000 rupees per month. Yes. A lot of ladies earn that much, some may get 150 to 200 rupees also and some even get 100 rupees.', 'If they have any problem in their house, whom do they go and speak to? Suppose if children have any problem, do they tell their parents or you? Or do they tell someone outside? What kind of problems?', 'Any kind of problems like something has happened in the school or outside, if they need money or if there happened any fight? Generally they tell to their parents. But if they feel like that the parents cannot manage, like the case of money, because many ladies have many things to do. Like some ceremony, something that has to be done for girls, or if they are having a brother and his wife then something need to be done for sister-in-law or they may have to do the renovation of the house for which they may have taken a loan. See here we have a place called Paryavaran Mitra. These people call it as pittu. So like that we have 18 to 20 pittas.', 'Are those yours? No. Everyone here runs it separately. Many ladies have taken loan from them. They don’t take interest. But they tell those ladies that whatever materials they get from garbage, they have to give them only and in return they always give the ladies 2 rupees lesser than the prevailing rate. Since she has taken a loan from them, she will never ask “Why you are giving me 2 rupees less”. So if they are having a problem like they have taken loan and don’t have money, then for fees they come and tell the teachers that “We have some problem and please help us”. If the problem is about medicines, we have a dispensary here and they take only 2 rupees as the token fee.', 'Is it here only? Yes. So those people also help them. It is open on Sundays and if a lady is not earning at all and don’t have money, then they give them free medicines by taking only 2 rupees.', 'Who is more smart and intelligent in a house. Men or the ladies? The ladies.', 'Is it ladies mostly? Yes. Mostly ladies.', 'Do the ladies have any feeling that they have to take care of the children or they just let them be? As we went everywhere, for example, when we went to Ranip, there ladies are very responsible about their kids. Whereas here all the kids are roaming outside. When I were doing the survey here the children said like that they go home at any time in the night according to their wish. Do they have any kind of closeness? They take care of their kids but most of them have a feeling that my child will not be going anywhere. So they will do their work and mostly kids will be roaming outside.', 'Who has been taken care the most in a house? Care means?', 'Like there are grand parents or in laws ,right? So I just wanted to know what is going on here in general. On Tekra?', 'Yes. On Tekra. On Tekra mostly the older people, like older ladies, have been taken care the most by everyone. Also when the kids are small, they are also get very much attention. Also now the anganwadis have come, so when people have the thought that their children should be educated, then they send them here. And those who don’t send their children, they keep roaming around. So there are 2 categories. Many people send their 2 year old kids to balwadi and there are many ladies whose child is not studying and roaming outside. Whenever they get hungry, they come home. And again they will go and play outside the house.', 'So generally older people are mostly taken care of? Yes.', 'Who takes care of them? Ladies only? Yes. Only ladies take care of them.', 'And gents? Gents would help. But mostly they would not be at home or they may drink alcohol and sleep. They will not be in their senses or they may go for gambling. Most of them will be working outside and come back in evening only. So they may not be able to do much for old people.', 'So how much do they spend on alcohol? Do they spend everything? Yes. They spend everything. Many people do like just earn and drink, earn and drink every time.', 'Don’t they give anything at home? No. they don’t give anything at home.', 'So there is need of awareness over here. We have done quite a lot of things here. We had done camps against alcohol, about family planning and recently in last month on T.B. So we give them lot of awareness. But the man himself should think of leaving alcohol.  Families would always force them to leave the alcohol. If he himself is telling that he want to leave alcohol, then he can be helped.  But if they have been sent to rehabilitation centers because of some other’s force, then he would stay there for 2 or 3 days and will run away from there. Right now the expenditure in those rehabilitation centers is about 7000-8000 rupees. They will provide the medication from there but we ourselves have to manage the food and accommodation. So twice in a week we need to take food there and pay for accommodation also. So the total expense is around 7000 rupees approximately. But the institution says if they are ready to leave the addiction by themselves, then they will bear the expense. But they don’t show any interest or response for that.', 'So they are not responding? No. They don’t want to do so. They say they are happy this way. The ladies are crying because they want their men to leave all these, but men enjoy it.', 'Do ladies drink alcohol? No. Nobody among ladies drink.', 'Nobody? No, nobody drinks. They have different kind of addictions like Chikni, Miraj or Supari. But they don’t drink.', 'Do they give advises to each other or every body does whatever they want to do? Mostly they do whatever they want to do.', 'Like do they tell kids to come home early at night? That kind of advises they give. But they don’t advise or preach their husbands because if she try to stop them, then they might beat her. They also put some restrictions on kids like girl shouldn’t go out after 8’o clock and they use to tell boys to come directly home after school.', 'Do the kids listen? Yes. Children listen to them.', 'How about doctor’s advises? When doctor advises, do they follow? We have to explain them a lot to make them convince. In our recent camp, for the ladies of Paryavaran Mitra, we has done full body checkups. So that we come to know what problems they are having. Because every day they carry almost 50kg weight on their heads. So many have spinal problems, many have stomach pain. Due to heavy weight lifting every day, they have some or the other problem on many body parts. So for that first we did the blood checkup for them.  And now we are sending these ladies, with 5 ladies at a time, to a hospital called GCS near Chamunda Bridge where they can get their x-rays and sonographic x-rays done.  Because many have stomach problem. Also if ladies want to do family planning surgery there is a place for that also. They do the C T scan for the ladies who are having chest pain. So we have come to know about the problems of lot of ladies. Just because these are costly, many ladies cannot do check up by their own. They will not spend that much money. They think instead if we can use this money for ration. Then we requested ladies to come and this is for them only. Many ladies had urinary stones and one or two ladies have diabetes. Once they have started, then they have to do follow up. We have to make them complete their medicines. For one or two ladies, they have water filled in their lungs. We can’t see all these from outside and understand the trouble they are having. They think like if we got a problem, then we have to face it. They think like if they are doing checkup, then some or the other physical problems will come out and tension will be increased. Mostly all ladies are thinking in this wrong way. They say that they don’t want to do the checkup and don’t want to get tensed. So we went door to door and convinced them that they can’t do these checkups in private hospital because it is very costly. We explained to them that “This is done for you only. If you are coming for the camp for doing the checkup, then you can know about the problems you are having and can take medication accordingly. If you come to know about it at a later stage, then there may not be any cure for that and will suffer so much.”', 'Did they agree? Yes, they agreed. Almost 40 ladies did checkups and it is going on right now.', 'What kind of bonding  do husband and wife share? Bonding?', 'Yes. Bonding? Are they close to each other or they stay together just because they have to? No. Most husbands and wives take care for each other. Like when they want to take them anywhere or go out for shopping or work or if there is any ceremony in a house to where she wants to go, then he would help his wife.', 'Are there mostly this kind of people or only a few? Those who do not having bonding?', 'Yes. Yes. There are a few families like that.  Not many. See if the husband comes by drinking alcohol and beats his wife daily, then definitely there will be bitterness in their relation.', 'Yes. That is true. So she thinks that it is better when the man is away from them because there are children in the house and so they will also get affected. The mother feels like if this is continuing, then nobody will come to marry their son or daughter. Their fight keep increasing every day and so they have lot of differences.', 'So do children listen to their parents? Yes.', 'Even after they grow up? Yes.', 'No problem happens? No.', 'When yesterday we were talking to the children, they were saying the same thing that they listen to their parents. But I thought they were just saying so because it was an interview. No. Most kids listen to their parents.', 'That is very good. For me it was like I had to come home early before night. But as we are boys we would say like even if we are out at 12’o clock at night, it is okay since we have  that kind of mind. So any such things like that over here, like they may go out at night after having dinner without telling at home or go out for just roaming somewhere. No. It is not like that over here. In this area, there are some goon elements like some don kind of people who say it is their rules over here. So fights happen anytime and people are scared that their son or daughter might get hurt. Not a single girl will go out after 8’o clock or 9’o clock. Big girls have to stay at home and even they themselves understand that this is safe for them. So big girls don’t go out, whereas for boys, the parents tell them that if you are going out, you should come back soon. The boys tells their parents as well, that they will come back at a certain time. So they have their commitments. Also they have the intimacy that as the boys told them that they will be back at a certain time, then they will come back.', 'Do you know any things where boys didn’t listen to parents or counter talk their parents? Like if parents didn’t allowed me to go for a tour or something, then I would counter back or explain to them and will be adamant like whatever they say I want to go? So do you remember any such incidents like the children don’t agree to the parent’s thoughts and explain or shout back at their parents ? Many times it happens other way round also? Do you remember any such incidents? There is no such thing that I remember. Because I have recently joined this community. Because mostly all children convince their parents as parents know that their children will not go out too much. If there is tour, then what we do is we make a certificate and when the mothers come here we will ask them everything and then only we will decide, whether the fee is to be paid or not to be paid.  Many times we pay the fees, because we know that they can’t pay. It will be hardly minimum 100 rupees. They read everything or if they don’t know how to read, then we will read and make them listen everything and only if they are convinced we will take their signature. So mostly there is no such context where children would answer back.  Yes but sometimes it happens like if the kids saw some thing with their friend, then they also want that and they ask their parents. But parents will convince them about their situation and would say to share the thing or would say like “We cannot buy that now. But if it is possible, then I would do it after collecting more money for that”. So mostly children would not counter back. If there is a bigger younger generation, then they also do some work like taking one round , helping some one in a work, help in construction work and all, so they might also get 100 to 200 rupees. And they would buy whatever they want from that. So there is less fight between parents and kids.', 'Who are the other important people for them apart from the family, with whom they can talk? You said know there would be 7 to 8 people in a family, so is there somebody outside the family like uncle or aunties from both side of parents or people like you, who is outside their family, but is important for them? Yes. It is possible. For those ladies, whose children come here, teacher is very important for them as teachers teach them so many values like do not cut plants or trees, you have to do savings etc. So they listen to the teachers. Also the children of 8 to 9 years come here, teachers are important for them as well. And they have respect for those teachers. Many a times if children have some problems in house, they ask teachers to help them and talk to parents, since they feel like parents would agree if teachers are saying them. For example, here girls get married at a very young age. So if the girls are saying us that “I don’t want to get married at this young age and my parents are thinking about my marriage ”, then we all or somebody from the community or Manav Sadhna will try to explain the parents to focus on the kids future now and get her married only after 18 years . So these things use to happen here. Manav Sadhna plays a big role in this.', 'So still child marriages are there over here? Child marriages are not much here. It used to be there before. Now it has reduced. But some people like Vancharas still do.', 'Has it been reduced now? Yes. It has been reduced now, but there are some people doing marriages at age of 15 or 16. We can go and ask them not to do so but we can’t force them.', 'Does forcing happens here, for good reasons also? Forcing means we can try to explain them, but we cannot force them.', 'Like first they may be refusing for something, but when you are telling and explaining to them and encouraging them every day about it by saying “This is to be done, since it is good for you”, then that person may change their opinion and agree to you. Because they will not be directly agreeing to it at first, and you will have to convince them for that by somehow giving them the knowledge about it. So do you use any tricks for that? Yes. We can do. There was a malaria camp here. Mostly when the notices are given, they didn’t even read and just throw it. So then what we did is we play a street drama by taking many children from the streets. So they use to come and see and through that the message is passed and asked them to come to the camp. Also we personally went door to door as well. We have to remind like this when every other camp comes. We shows them clear pictures of the theme to get their attention, then only they will understand what we are trying to say, and so they come. Unless they come, they will not understand what is it. So we use to do many things like playing street dramas, informing them from door to door and keeping camps or science fairs. So that they will get attracted and come. Then whatever message we want to give, we can give them.', 'You have to keep trying something or the other. Right? Yes. We have to keep trying.', 'So teacher is the important person to children. Likewise for husband and wife or ladies and gents, is there any such important person ? Ladies can’t tell everything to her husband, like if her mother-in-law is troubling her or something. Sometimes there will be some other person to whom she can discuss her problems with, right. Yes, like there are neighbors. As they are staying there more many years, they become friends and they can tell to them. And mostly here some relatives will be staying near to them for sure. In a family there might be two brothers or two brother and one sister, so all of them will be staying close to each other. So uncles or father’s sister will be there near to them. So they can share to each  other.', 'In this community is there any person to whom others will never say no to that person for any work he or she say? Like as I approached you for my work, you had never said no to me. For example, they might not be refusing to anything that an important person from outside or you say to them. So is there anybody like that over here. Yes. There are leaders over here. Like here in community center there is a person called Raju Bhai. He is born and brought up in Tekra only. He helps lot of community centers also. He has been the coordinator also. If we wants to send some message to ladies or gents here, then if Raju Bhai says, everyone will agree. They look up to him as a good person. He supports them in everything like in sickness, marriages, death or if people want to gather together and there is no place for that. See at many places there are small streets and there will not be space for conducting marriages. Like that if someone’s death has occurred, then there will not be space for the people to go and sit. So this community center is made for that purpose also. If people from this community need help like that, then we help them by giving the place. So if Raju Bhai says, then they would listen to him.', 'Is there any other person to whom they will not be able to refuse? That they will not refuse to Raju Bhai?', 'Yes. They will not refuse Raju Bhai. But then….. Like he will not refuse to us?', 'No. I will explain to you. If Raju Bhai is telling them something, as they are keeping so much respect for him, then they will not refuse to him. Right? Is there anybody else other than Raju Bhai to whom they will not refuse for anything? Yes. There are a lot of relationships like that also. They are those pittapeople. If ladies need money and ask them, they will not refuse. If the ladies need something else also, those people help them.', 'How is the food habits here? How many times do they eat in a day? Their eating habits are normally like us only. They store a few things. But mostly they buy on daily basis. For today, they will buy today and eat it today itself.', 'Is it like that? Yes. And they eat good food. It is not like that they just let it go and eat bad. It may happen like when ladies go for collecting papers from garbage, so they may or may not get time. So then they give money to kids as they cook food late in the afternoon and they buy from shops like packed foods. But the food that they cook is nice food, even though it is twice in a day.', 'Do they eat 2 times and not 3 times? Yes. In the afternoon they bring snacks from outside and have it with tea.', 'Do they eat in the morning and evening? Yes. At 12’o clock or 1’o clock in the afternoon, they have lunch and at 8’o clock or 9’o clock at night, they have dinner. In that they will have kichdi, Sabji, roti.', 'So there is no problem for food? No. And they would bring everything in small quantity every day. Like oil for 10 rupees, rice for 10 rupees, sugar and tea are also bought like that.', 'So they buy every day and cook with that in that day itself. Yes. Hardly a few people store food items. But most of them do this way.', 'How much sugar do they use in their food? It is only in tea.', 'Only in tea? Yes. They don’t use sugar in Sabji or dal. They don’t like sweets, they like spicy things.', 'How many times they will have tea in a day? 2 or 3 times a day ? Yes. 2 or 3 times in a day. They tea in the morning, then around 1 ‘o clock in the after noon and around 3’o clock or 4’o clock in the evening.', 'That means they don’t use too much of sugar. No.', 'See ,you had a diabetes camp recently in which you explained them everything about the problems that might occur because of sugar. So are there anyone who stopped sugar in the tea after that? Some people use less. But they are so addicted to tea that wherever they are, when the time comes, like when it becomes 1’o clock their head starts aching. So they have to drink tea.', 'Okay. But do they drink tea without sugar? No. Only those who have diabetes reduce the quantity. But others who don’t have diabetes, they want sugar as much as they want. If we give them less sugar in tea, they would call it as bland tea.', \"So there is no problem of sugar. But do they have any idea that sugar is harmful and if you are leaving it then it is beneficiary for them? They know, but they don't do that.\", \"They won't do? No. They say like what is the need \\xa0and what are we going to take with our life. It is like that only for them. So they live their life with all the enjoyment.\", \"So that is not much important for them, even if they know about it. I can tell you that so many ladies of the 60 years old haven’t gone still also, for doing checkups. Whatever it is they would not go to the dispensary. They say like if we go to the dispensary then of course some diseases will be told to us know and it will come out. Instead they will just bear it. So they don't want to do the checkups.\", \"How is their willpower? Suppose they are sick and if the doctor or you is saying them to leave certain things like Chikni or Miraj or suppose if you are telling them that these symptoms are seen in you and there are chances that you may get these diseases and therefore you leave it, then will they leave it? Some people may do that. \\xa0But some people may say that we are alive and we have this habit and that we are not able to leave. Then they don't listen.\", \"They don't listen. No. Many ladies have gone and seen movies or something like that from the cancer department. So if they really feel like that, then they will leave it. Whereas there are some who might say like ” Oh, my life is over. Why should I leave this”. Then they continue, even if they understand.\", 'Suppose they have done checkup and if there is cholesterol, then they will have to reduce salt. Then will they reduce? Yes, then they will reduce since they understand. For example, here when lot of ladies had diabetes then they reduced like they skipped rice or potato. They left it since they were told to leave it and had done accordingly.', 'That means they agree. Yes', 'So is it like they have completely left it once they have left. Or is it like that they will have it sometimes when nobody is noticing. No. It is not like that. Those who are caring for their health will definitely do.', 'How many such people would be there? \\xa0Everybody? At least 50 to 60 percent you can count on.', 'That means half of them will agree and half of them will not agree. Yes.', 'Suppose if they are going for some ceremony, \\xa0then will they be lenient or will they feel like the person will feel bad? No some people will observe it strictly. In those food if there is a restricted item then they would eat something else.', \"How about exercises over here? \\xa0Do people exercise? Ladies don't do at all, because their exercises are done automatically. As everyday they carry weight, \\xa0they bend,  collect garbage and roam about. So their exercises are done automatically. Since there is a gym here down to there, lot of gents come there.\", 'You mean about the gents of 20 to 30 years old and not the aged people of 35 to 40 years of age, right? Then what do those people do? No one of them do exercise. \\xa0They do nothing.', 'What could be the reason for not exercising? There is no reason.', \"There could be some reason like laziness which stop them from exercising. Do you have any idea about what do they think? They might be thinking like that they need to go very early to the job or if they are sleeping late at night then they may not be able to get up early. So as soon as they get up they have to take bath, eat breakfast and go for job. Then they don't have time.\", 'Do they do jobs like their physical exercises are done by doing that job itself? For some people it is done, since they are having jobs like to lift or keep things and so it is done. Whereas for some people it does not happen.', 'For ladies it is definitely done. Yes, for \\xa0ladies it is done.', \"How about kids? Some children do like they come here and do yoga or physical exercise. But they don't take it seriously. Also here there is scout, \\xa0so in that also they make them do exercises.\", 'Suppose if you are advising them that if you are doing exercises every day for 30 minutes then it is good for your body and will live longer, then will they listen to you or no? Yes, they will do. \\xa0One or two people might do and rest all will not do.', 'Nobody will do. No.', \"Like how you just said that with the help of street play they get attracted, is there any such way to encourage them for doing exercise? We use to keep here on Saturday for ladies and they would come around 3 o’clock in the afternoon. We try two or three times to make them do exercises. So they will understand that they can do this from home also. But they don't have time, \\xa0they are very busy. They go in the night for collecting the garbage material,  in the morning they do the sorting,  they need to cook food, get children ready and send them to school. Their whole day goes in all these things . In afternoon that take rest for 2 hours. Then again they have their routine. So they don't have time. They have scarcity of time especially for ladies.\", \"How about gents? They don't want to do exercise since they are lazy.\", \"Do you have any idea about the things that we can do to make them start doing exercise? Gents haven't tried even to do exercise, \\xa0since they are having the feeling that they are doing the physical work. In the morning they get up, \\xa0take bath  and leave the house. Also ladies don't get time. There are many ladies who have problems and \\xa0they do. They do some small exercises only if they are advised by the doctor. Rest of them, nobody does. Even if we are explaining to them, they say like they don't have time. Then what can we do.\", 'When you are conducting camps and someone is been advised, \\xa0then would you to do follow ups to check whether the advice is being followed? Yes, \\xa0follow up is done. During camps if somebody is been advised to leave a particular thing since they are having some problem, \\xa0then after 2 weeks we use to pay visit to their house.', 'So the visit is done. Yes. It is done.', \"For how long you will keep doing that? Till we don't get a proper result for that.\", 'So in that house you pay visit in every two weeks. Yes. Here in health department we have two people, one coordinator and one helper. They go and pay visit in the house.', 'That is very good. Suppose somebody is having a problem or if they are been admitted, then we have to go to their house in every 2 days or every week. So that we can understand about the improvement of their health. So definitely the ladies will go and pay visit in every 2 days or in every 2 week in however cases are there, to check whether that person is cured.', \"Have these people heard about diabetes or they don't have any idea? Yes they have heard. There \\xa0is been a camp about diabetes, so everybody knows about it.\", 'So mostly everybody knows. Yes. Mostly everybody knows.', 'Do they have any knowledge about what is the reason for diabetes, \\xa0how it happens and which parts of the body gets affected? Yes. Because mostly all the ladies came and there was an entire video presentation. Also the doctors were there, \\xa0so they have knowledge about it like what need to be done, what are the things that not to be done, how diabetes happens and to reduce diabetes what should not be eaten. They know everything.', 'So they have the entire idea about it. Yes.', 'How much is the effect of diabetes in this area or in this community? It is minimal. It is not much.', 'Oh, \\xa0it is not much. Those people who come to our place, out of that hardly two or three people have. Rest of them, mostly they don’t have. Also those who have very high are being told. Those who have normal or don’t have diabetes are not being told anything. When the doctors came there gave medicines and it is been given from here. Here there is one dispensary and from there the routine checkup for diabetes is also done.', 'Do you have that regular checkup for diabetes? Yes, \\xa0they do regular checkup for diabetes. If they say that they want to do the checkup for diabetes, then on that day the doctors will do checkup for them. They have the equipment for that.', \"So checkups are done only when they tell. Is \\xa0it possible that many might be having diabetes and neither the doctor had done any checkups for them nor they haven’t went for the checkup? So neither you nor doctors have any idea about it. Yes, many ladies don't even come. I told you know that they are scared and because of that they don’t come. There are many who feel that I need to get myself checked. Also those who have got high diabetes have skipped things as advised and in every 15 days they go to the doctor for regular checkups. And they will check how much diabetes they are having, \\xa0has it increased or decreased.\", 'So they have that much of seriousness. Yes.', 'But very few people are like that as per you, right? Yeah,15 to 20 ladies.', 'Also when you told me about jobs, whether the area for collecting the recyclable materials from garbage is allocated? Do \\xa0they go to the area which is very close by or are they going to the far off areas also? They go little far also of around 7 to 8 kilometers or 10 kilometers. Also they have it decided that when those people are going to such an area, they will do the work without causing any fight. If the friends are going together, then they would decide that whatever they are getting from this area will be divided equally and take. Like that everybody goes in different areas like CGO area, Navrangpura, Naranpura, Vadaj, Usmanpura, income tax and on this side there is Sabarmati, Ankur, Akhbar Nagar, Subhash bridge, then there are different societies, many go in hotels also and many go to party places so that they can find lot of things from there . Like that there are so many places that they distribute among themselves. As they are staying near to each other, they know that this lady will be going in a certain area and therefore I should go in another area.', 'Do they go by walking or in any other way? They go in pedal rickshaws since many ladies have those pedal rickshaws. Lot of ladies go by walking also.', \"Suppose they are staying here then Subhash bridge is very nearby and CG Road is far off. Will they then have fights like any internal fights? They don't fight. But the thing is that in some places they would get a lot of material. For example, the CG Road is entirely a shopping area, so there you would get polythene, cartoons, water bottles. When people go outside and buy water bottles, they throw those in the dust bin only and will not take it home. So mostly all ladies go towards CG Road. Because there is so many places to cover, \\xa0so one lady may not be able to reach. So like that they share.\", 'So there is no problem. no, there is no problem. Even if 5 to 6 ladies are going to one place, they divide the area separately like I will go to this side and the others can go to the other side . Then whatever they get in their respective area, they take it.', \"Now you told me that they get salary daily and get food with that, then if somebody is falling sick then what will they do? It may happen sometimes that they don't have money with them. Then they come and ask us Give something as loan as we don't have money. We will pay you back whenever we get money” . Many ladies do like that.\", \"Ok, they do that. So \\xa0there is not much problem. Also you said that from this side and from Nalbazar area, people go for masonry work. Do they go on their own or is there any agency like NGO which would contact you and give them the jobs? No, NGOs \\xa0don't contact us. \\xa0But when there are buildings under construction or when AUDA is constructing buildings, there is many big construction people who receives contracts from them to bring so many people and they take only commission .So then as you saw at Akhbar Nagar, they gather at one place.\", \"So those are agencies only know. You can't call it agency, \\xa0maybe you can call it agents because they know that here people gather together. One such place is Akbar Nagar, in Nava Vadaj also there is such a place where people gather together. So if there is any plumbing work, construction work or any other small labor work, then they would come there. And if they know any person who is capable, since they meet there daily, then they will take them in one tempo or any vehicle and in the evening they bring them back at the same place.\", 'Do they come to you for asking any jobs like saying ” Please help us to get a job with your contacts ”. For example here there is a Pan shop where his sister is there who is doing fashion designing from NIFT. Now she has a degree which is very good. But suppose because of the family background or any other reason if she is not getting any job outside ,then she will have to go to a placement agency or Manav Sadhna, then the things will work out with just a call made by someone. Does anybody helps like that or is there anybody who asks for such kind of help? Yes, there are many children like that. For example, \\xa0here the computer classes are going on. So there are many children who has completed 10th or 12th and then done computer courses. So the people from call centers or typing or data entry might come here and give offer. Recently there was an offer from Pepsi that they need people to do data entry job. They had criteria like the person should be above 18 years old and should be knowing computer. Then they had done one entire session for training. And from the entire Thekra they had collected all the boys who had passed 12th and who know computer and then provided training for them. And if they feel like they have passed, they give them the offer mentioning that this is the job that you have to do and this is the salary. Therefore we keep these kind of camps, \\xa0so that they can get jobs. Then as you told if a girl is studying nicely and if she needs,  then there is a sister organization of Manav Sadhna called Gramshree, where they handover the work like embroidery and all. So we tell them to go there and show your performance and if they feel like you are capable then they may absorb you. These are the things that are going on.', 'So it is not like they would struggle themselves alone. They go and ask for help also. Yes.', \"How about the relatives? \\xa0Would they ask help from relatives ? Or is it like they don’t have good relation or not in good talking terms? Is it like that? They can ask but there is no need. Mostly here the people need each other’s help. So there are less fights. Like a brother may need the help of other brother in the midnight or anytime. So they don't believe in fights.\", 'Do they have trust in NGOs \\xa0or do they say like these people are of no need? That depends on the mentality of those few people.', 'Yes how about them? Yeah, \\xa0they say like ” What good they can do for us?”. Some people have feelings like this and some people have ego. Even if they are egoistic people, the family member or children of those are connected with us. But we cannot change the mentality or thinking of that egoistic person.', 'How many such people will be there? They might be very less know. Yeah, very less people are like that. Because many a times Manav Sadhna has done a lot of help for this people. So everybody knows about what kind of work Manav Sadhna is doing and for what they are doing. They are doing it for us only, know.', 'Except Manav Sadhna, are there any other NGOs in this area? Recently there has started a new NGO called Jeevan Theerth. It is been started to 23 years back. The lady who is the trustee, who was doing the Manav Sadhna work only, is taking care of this center. But she left because of some problems that she had and started her own.

They give lot of training like computer courses, beauty courses or stitching classes for everybody.

Those kind of things don't come much in Manav Sadhna.\", 'No not about Manav Sadhna. Do \\xa0these people take advantage of things like these provided by the government? No , they don’t take advantage of that.', \"That means they come here inside and whatever here is been provided they are ready to take. They don't go out. Yes.\", \"That means we can say that their way of thinking is quite closed. Do these people have bank account or they deal with cash for everything? Some people have bank account like in a family may be one person will be having. If somebody is not educated and they don't have the necessary document, \\xa0then they would not be having a bank account. But mostly one account will be always there.\", \"Mostly everybody has. Yes.

Then how about insurance? Do they take insurance or not? They don't take \\xa0insurance.\", 'Not of any single kind? No', 'Does everybody has phones ? Yes. Mostly everyone has.', 'Does each and every member of a family have a phone? No. Not with each and every person, but in one house there will be at least one phone. Mostly all youngsters have phone with them and there will be one more phone with one of the other family members.', 'Okay.  Do ladies keep phones? The ladies hardly keep phones.', 'Hardly any, not many ladies? Not many ladies. If there is causing a problem in contacting with each other, then in such situation they would keep. But here very few ladies keep phones. But at least one person in a house is having a phone, so from that house, that person can be contacted.', 'What type of phones do they have? Do they have landline or mobile? They have mobile only.', 'Do they have smart phones? What kind of features are there in their phones? Ladies only keep simple phones. The youngsters don’t have enough money to buy new phones, so they buy second hand phones. But they keep smart phones.', 'So they bring android smart phones? Yes.', 'Do the gents, who are the fathers of younger generation, keep phones? Yes. They keep phones.', 'What type of phones do they keep? They keep simple phones. They use only the dialing part, since they have difficulties in saving the numbers. They use to keep a diary besides them.', 'Is there any popular phone in use over here? The simple phones of Nokia.', 'Is it simple phones of Nokia? Yes. They use the simplest one that costs around 1000 rupees only. Because even if it is falling down somewhere, they don’t need to worry so much about that, since it is of only 1000 rupees.', 'How do they use the phone? What are the ways that they use the phone? For making calls and to listen to songs.', 'Only to make calls and listen to songs? Yes.', 'How about messaging? Don’t they use it for that? No. They don’t know how to do messages. Because they can’t read and write. Then how would they give messages in English ?', 'Do they  use phones for alarm or radio? No. They don’t use phones for alarm. Because they have the habit of getting up early. So they don’t need an alarm.', 'How about children? Children like youngsters use radio and messages. That is natural.', 'So children use all these.

For example in my case, I always use WhatsApp a lot and the internet is always on. So how about the children over here? Do they use all these or do they use any other applications from the phone? They use phones for downloading movies and songs or like you said they use Facebook, WhatsApp also. They use it like this and that’s it. Mainly the use for songs. Here people like Gujarati songs too much. So they download Gujarati songs and listen to them.', 'Who is this Gaman? I don’t know.', 'Yesterday when I was talking to the boys and they were writing. And when I asked for whom are you using flute, then some boy told me that it is for Gaman. I think he is a Gujarati artist.', 'Is there anybody who uses phone for getting jobs? No.', 'Nobody is like that? No.', 'So nobody even has an idea that they can use phones for many other purposes like you can get applications through which they can get jobs. There are very few children, especially boys, who are very much connected to their phones and read general knowledge in phones or download applications. There are very few boys like that, hardly 5 percent.', 'Now a days there are some ads that comes in phone, which say that if you have an account in your phones you can easily transfer money from that account. Do anybody like boys use phones for such purpose? Yes. Some must be doing.', 'Like Paytm, through which they can do recharge. Like nowadays people have television with TataSky, then that can be recharged or phone or electricity bill can be recharged. Do they use phone for such purposes? Yes. They will be using.', 'Are you sure that they use it in every house? No. They might not be using in all the houses. Only those who are educated, little smart and who understand all these things will be using it.', 'See we are working on a thing right now that instead of these people roaming around for jobs to meet contractor, we want to make an application in the phone through which labors and contractors can be connected to each other directly. Then the in between agents will be removed. If the contractor needs he can send a message directly and labors would know that he have to go at this place at this time. We have the entire database ready with us, so everyday according to their convenience, they can go. Suppose if they are getting jobs through the phone like that, then will they be ready to pay the charges? Or will they think like that they will do it on their own and don’t want to take such help. Some might pay.', 'It will become easier for them. They don’t have to go and stand in the sun and wait for some body. If only there is a guarantee of job, then only they need to go otherwise don’t go. So if any such scheme is working out, will they be ready to pay money or they are still narrow minded? Here everybody has their fixed places like they know they have to go a certain place for job. Many people’s jobs are fixed, like they have to go to this place every day. But there are some people who have talent but don’t have jobs. So those people can pay the money. Most people will not put money on such thing.', 'But those people has to go every day. Right? And there is no guarantee that the person would come and take them. Yes. That is right. If not that, they will get something else. And if they don’t get, then they will return home. They will not be having the feeling that “I haven’t got work today, so how will I manage” .', 'What if we explain to them? Then that might work.', 'Yes. Because when the agents are removed, then their salary will increase. But money is needed to continue this system. So can we raise money for that? That’s why I am asking. Then they may do. Yes, it is possible.', 'So if we are explaining to them, then will they be ready to pay small amount? Yes. They may pay.', 'Suppose if we do a survey like right now we are doing, so like that if we send an SMS to them, then will they reply back to the SMS? No. They will not reply.', 'Nobody will reply? Not even children? Not even children. Because they will not understand. May be the children may do, but not the other people because they don’t know how to write. At the most they may be able to read, because it would be in English. They might be reading it, may be asking their friends. But they don’t know how to write. Then how would they reply?', 'If the SMS is paid and not free, then will the children do? Or will they say let it be, why spend on this? If it is paid they will not do.', 'What about if the SMS are free? Then will they reply? Yes. Then they may reply.', 'When we call to customer care, then there will be a recording like “For English press 1 or press 2”. So like that if they asked a question like “You have went at this place and how was your experience. Press 1 for good. Press 2 for bad.” .Then will they reply for those or will they get bored and disconnect the phone? Some people may do. The young children may do, but others may disconnect.', 'Suppose there is a call center or if I call them directly, then will they reply? Yes. Then they will reply. In the other way they may get confused like what they are saying and they may not understand anything.', 'In general what kind of electronic devices are there in the houses over here? Only the basic items like fan, lights ,T.V. And if they are living even better then they might have fridge also. Not more than that.', 'How about phones? Yes. They have phones.', 'How about computers? No. Nobody has computer. Hardly 3 to 4 or 1 to 2 houses have computer in the whole area. Computers are used very less over here.', 'Is it so? They use less of computers. Yes.', 'So there is no need of question about tablets or something like that. No.', 'Yesterday when I spoke to some 5 or 6 children there, I think it was 6, 3 of them told they have computers or have laptops. Are they speaking truth? They might have. If someone from the house has a government job, if they have bought it as second hand or if they are getting an old tablet from others, then they may be having.', 'They are not doing jobs. One of them told he had both computer and laptop. Then I don’t know. We need to check.', 'When I saw him, he didn’t look like as he is having one. But he said his elder brother is using it. Then he must be having.', 'Okay, then he must be having. Do they use T.V only for entertainment or for any other purposes? No. They use it for entertainment only.', 'How do these people mingle socially like attending a function or during festival celebrations? First of all this place is Ramapir No\\xa0Tekro. So these Ramapir people have Norta for 9 days. So all 9 days everybody gathers together and on 9th day they have one big celebration where they give food to everyone. The temple people would collect money from everyone or the leader would spend his own money , to give food to the people from the entire Tekra . So such fair is done. Also there are done some celebrations like marriages. Also during Navratri, people use to gather for 9 days. Dasara is also very popular, so on Dasara there use to have one big fair because people have been fasted for the 9 days. People stay awake all night which is called Jagaran and there will be celebrations on road.', 'If there is a marriage in one house, will they give food the people of entire Tekra? No. They call only relatives.', 'Do they socially love each other? Yes.', 'How about festivals like Holi, Diwali ? Do they meet up then? Suppose if it is Holi, then do they play Holi together? Or just because it is a holiday, will they go to village? No, they celebrate as they can. During Holi, Diwali they visit each other’s place. Some may go to their village if they want to do so and if there is any other work to be done, they would do that also.', 'Do they ? Yes.', 'Is it mostly with relatives or with friends? Any one in family or friends or whom so ever they can tell. Like when a person says something, to whom would their son or daughter would listen properly, they use to tell to that person.', 'Okay. Normally it is done that way. Do they have the tradition of visiting each other’s place? Yes. In the evening they visit each other’s house and sit there. And if someone is sick, they go and ask about their wellbeing.', 'Normally at such time what type of food do they cook? When? At the time of festival?', 'No. Yeah, okay. When it is festival, then? Here people eat less of dal rice. Mostly they eat roti and Sabji. At the time of festival they make Shira.', 'Why don’t they make dal rice? Is it expensive for them? No. They don’t have time because they have to make tiffin. So they eat very less dal rice. Since the boys don’t stay at home,  they have to give them tiffin. They need roti and dry Sabji. So they don’t get time to make four things. We all usually eat roti, Sabji and dal rice at home. But these people  eat dal rice very rarely. So during holidays they make more dal rice. If they know how to make paneer and Sabji, they would make that sometimes like when there is a guest who comes like once in a year or when the son-in-law or other-in-laws of daughter has come . On such occasions they make such things. They get mango juice from outside or else they bring mango and make the juice at home. They make Shira, Laapsi or things like that.', 'Suppose if we are doing just a visit to their house for some time, then will they make tea or they just give water? No. they make tea.', 'How about juice? They make sherbet very rarely, but mostly they make tea for sure.', 'So normally they will make tea only. Yes. Tea only will be there.', 'Okay. But is it in this way like they don’t have food at their home to eat for themselves, and when the guest comes then have to give tea for them.  So somehow they will make tea and serve it to guest, even if they don’t give milk for their own crying child. Yes. Many times that happen. Because we have seen such things here like if guest comes they will take care of those guests, even if they don’t have anything to eat for themselves .So they borrow things and will give food for the guests.', 'What is the reason for that, even if their own child is in that condition? Despite of their situation, like even if they don’t have money, they have to take care of the guest because of their prestige in the community. And if they are not taking care of them, then it is like insulting the guest. So it is their first duty, to give food to the guests. They also will never keep their kids hungry, they feed them anyhow, at least by borrowing, but they themselves will stay hungry. Children will never remain hungry. They themselves may remain hungry for one day, but for kids, somehow they may manage food and feed them. If their condition is so bad, then if there is any relatives staying nearby, they will also help. See if you don’t have anything at home, then they would give one bowl of kichdi, Sabji. They use to take care in that way.', 'So they are afraid of ruining their respect in the community. Right? Yes.', 'You just told me about the fairs. Approximately how many times these kinds of fairs happen in a year? 2 to 3 times.', 'Okay. 2 to 3 times. That is very good. Which language do these people know generally? Gujarati.', 'Gujarati? Do they know how to write, read and speak? Most of them don’t know to write. Only the educated people can write. Everyone know how to speak, some of them even don’t know reading. Those who are completely uneducated would not be knowing how to read and write.', 'But those would be the people who are grandparents, father-in-law and mother-in-law. Right? No. there are other people who don’t know how to write and read, as they were not sent to the school right from the childhood and they might not be able to read and write.  Suppose if they are staying in a village, then they are not sent to school and only do house hold works.', 'Do people speak Hindi here? Very few. Not many.', 'Are they less? Yes. They have come from outside like Rajasthan, U.P .', 'Yesterday some boy told me that here everyone knows Hindi and less of Gujarati. There are some people who speak Hindi. Around 10 percent people.', 'Okay. Around 10 percent. Many people from U.P, whom we call as Bhaiya, stay over here.', 'Yesterday that boy told me that his parents know both Hindi and Gujarati. All of them told me like that. I think everyone told me like that just because one of them said so. Is it like that? No. It may be because in and around their community, where they are staying, it might be that way. People from U.P stay there, so they might have learned both Hindi and Gujarati.', 'Ok. That means there is nothing much to say about that. It might be happened like they might have come from U.P in search of work. Initially they know Hindi only and after staying around Gujarati people, they might have learnt Gujarati also.', 'Yes. They might have learnt Gujarati and also people here, who know Gujarati only, might have learnt Hindi from them. Yes.', 'How about English? Do only a few youngsters know English? Only a few.', 'So no English? No, no English.', 'Do the people knowing Hindi, do they only to speak or do they know to read also?

Those who have Gujarati in their phone use Gujarati only.', 'Do the majority of them use Gujarati? Yes.', 'I don’t remember anything more now to ask, if there is something I will call you. Is it ok? Okay.', 'Which connection do people use in their phones over here? Mostly Uninor or else they use the connection of whichever company provides them more freebies. Some people who are using internet use Vodafone. There is also Airtel. If people want to make calls locally and talk more, then Uninor is best because they give more minutes for free calls. So mostly everyone has Uninor.', 'Do people know the trick about the recharge cards? Like if we buy a card of 40 to 50 rupees but the balance inside is for 80 to 100 rupees. So do the people use and throw that card and buy another one? Many people do that.', 'People do that know. Like if you want to get a free SMS package, you would buy a card, use it and throw. Then buy a new card. Yes. Many people do that.', 'These things are there for many things. So they do those things. Yes.', 'Do these people know about the new schemes coming? Yes. Every boys know about these things. Recently there was a scheme in one of the companies that you just need to submit all the documents and take a free card with the balance of 100 rupees. So majority people would do that. They buy the card, use the balance and would break the card and throw it away or else give it to their friends. They know and do all these things and keep telling about it to their friends also.', 'Which is the majority kind of people over here, Muslim or Hindu? Majority of them are Hindu.', 'All are Hindu?

Kerosene.', 'On an average in one house how many people would be there of 17 years of age or lesser than that? 4 to 5 will be there including kids.', 'Okay. 4 to 5 would be there. Yes.', 'There would be a head of the family like the one…… The one who handles everything in a family.', 'Yes. That person. It would be either ladies or gents. So what is educational qualification of that person? Will they be educated? I am just asking generally. On an average they are uneducated, but they have experience of many years so they can handle everything. Like they know approximately the worth of everything that they buy, and about the money that they would get back.', 'Yes. That is true. But they have not done any education. No. They are not educated, but they have a lot of knowledge.', 'Haven’t they studied like passing 10th or like that? No. They are not educated.', 'Will the head of the family be generally gents or are there ladies also? Ladies are also there. And gents are also there. Both comes as 50-50.', 'Mostly only labor class are staying here .right? Yes. All are labors.', 'Do they have any feeling that we have to earn by their own? I mean nobody here is doing farming. Right? No.', 'So out of the working people , suppose somebody has pan shop, then is it their own like doing a business and himself earning out of it. How many people are like that, like what we call as self-employed? Suppose if ladies are having stitching machine at home, they would do their own work and earn for themselves. It is not like earning by working at somebody else’s place or by doing a job. So in general which class is there, are they doing job or are self-employed. Like if he has his own garage, then he is self-employed. Majority of them are self-employed.', 'Are they self-employed ? Yes. They have garage, they do cycle repair, they do stitching or have pan shop. Many people have pitta. So these are self-employment. Rag pickers are also called self-employed itself, know. They themselves go, pick and sell. Nobody has a share in that. So mostly it is like that only. Even taking rounds is also self-employment. They would go, if they want to go.  And they get money for whatever luggage is there. So mostly there is this class.', 'What is the preliminary source of fuel for them in cooking? Is it kerosene or LPG? They all have LPG, but they use it less so that the cylinder run for 2 to 3 months. They also use kerosene, as they get kerosene using their BPL card. Those who don’t get kerosene will use Chula also. They bring wood pieces and cook on Chula.', 'What do mostly they use? They use both. Because now there is a scheme that for 9 months you get 9 cylinders but  after that for the next 3 months in a year you need to pay double the money. We need to pay nearly 800 to 900.', 'With BPL cards, they get subsidy for kerosene. Right? Yes, they get subsidy. People say that as they are getting only 9 cylinders, they should be using it in such a way that it should last the whole year and so that they don’t have to pay extra.

I asked him like “Can you tell me one reason for why you don’t want to give the interview”. But he just said that he doesn’t want to give interview. He doesn’t like these things but he has a lot of information. He knows each and every person of this Tekra. So if you want you should ask him somehow.', 'I can just talk to him, but that is not the problem. My sir is in Dubai and if I talk, I can only get the information and sir will not get any idea.

Yes, \\xa0at the age of 18 or 19 she must have got married. And also here there is one community in which the marriages are done in the childhood itself.', 'Okay. Even in our community center, there come many children who are already married. And still they are studying. Some are studying in 10th and some are studying in 12th and they are already married.', \"Don't they refuse or do something like that? Nobody will listen to them. \\xa0Everyone is like that itself in their community.\", 'What caste or community is this? All are staying mixed here. There are Nagod, Rabari, Bharwad, Prajapati, Marwadi. So in this whole area all the caste community are covered.', 'Suppose in the family if there is having any internal problem or if they are having any problem from outside, then to whom would they go and speak to? They speak to each other within themselves.', 'So it is internal only. Yes it is internal, \\xa0they will speak face to face.', 'Suppose if there is a problem in the house like which is related to children or money, then to whom will they talk to? Suppose there are grandparents who have two sons, then mostly they stay separate.', 'Not like that. See, \\xa0as far as fighting is concerned they deal with it face to face. They would fight also.', 'Not fighting. But \\xa0suppose if there is some problem, \\xa0for example, suppose if somebody is seriously ill or if there is something that they cannot tell in the house like the problem of child marriage. They are getting married at a very young age and nobody is listening to what they have to say. So is there anybody to whom they can go and speak, from heart to heart ? Or is there someone who can come here and talk to them? There is nobody like that.', 'Ok, \\xa0so that means whatever it is, it will end up within the house itself. Yes, it is within the house.', 'If we are considering one house in this community, on an average who is the smartest of all? Mostly they listen to the elderly people.', 'The elderly people? Yes, in the house.', 'Will it be grandfather or grandmother? It could be grandfather, grandmother or the elder brother. Also there are a few leaders in their community. They listen to hem also.', 'Okay. Is there a good bonding amongst the parents and the children? Or is it like let them do whatever they want to do? Like if the children are roaming around then will they be allowed to be as like that itself ? Here it is like they will let them as whatever they want to do. Hardly there are few families who take care of their children or children listening to them.', 'Do the parents take care of their children? Yes, yes they take care. But \\xa0it is less, not much.', 'But as you said if some families are having five or six children, then whom do they take care the most? Is it the child who is very quiet and nice or the one who is the youngest or the grandchildren? In the community there are 20 percent families who take care of themselves, their children, parents or grandparents. But those who are having many children, it is very natural that they are not able take care because they are busy with their own life. Also there are some families who leave their kids to do whatever they want to do. So all these things are there as a mixture.', 'Oh, It is mixture. Then how about the mothers? \\xa0Are they close to their children? There is. \\xa0But not that much.', 'Suppose if a child is having a problem, \\xa0then can he go and talk about it to his parents? Suppose if he talks, then will they listen to him or not? They tell, but still they are very close.', 'Not like very close. No.', 'Okay. Then what is the reason for that? At every other place it is like that if a mother is there, she will take care of her child very much and sometimes by seeing her child she may start crying also, since she is that much close to them. She would take that much care, thinking that nothing should happen to her child. Even children will take care of their parents as well. Yes, see if you are your own child of one or one and half year old, then a little extra care need to be taken for them. Here in the evening when I go to clinic there I see incidents like when a child is got hurt, they visit the dispensary only after 2 or 3 days to show it.', \"Oh, is it like that? That is why there is no need for the question of taking care or things like that. Recently the was a boy of 5 years old who was having fever for last one week, \\xa0still she didn't come to take medicines for him.\", 'Do you have any idea about the reason behind this? They have this belief that it would get alright or will be cured in a day. \\xa0For example,  if somebody is having cold, then it would take normally 5 days to get cured either you are having medicine or not. But if you are not taking medicine, then it may lead to TB or you may have cough. But these people are having the belief that if a person is getting fever, then it would get alright by itself. If somebody has got hurt, \\xa0then he will say that it would get cured. They have this kind of belief. Also there are some people who are religious.', 'That means it is about those Baba or sage who put that sacred vibhuti powder. Yes, \\xa0they do that. There are more people like that over here.', 'It is too much to wait for one week. Is it because that the person don’t know about that? Because if a person waits then normally it can be for one or two days, right. Waiting for one week means either they don’t know or they might haven’t got informed that the children is having fever. We had given the awareness for those children who come over here, to go to the dispensary once they are having cough or fever. But still those who are elders don’t believe in it.', 'Okay, so the elderly people are those who don’t agree. Is there an atmosphere in the house where they can give advices to each other or no? They give lot of advices.', 'Too much of advice they use to give. Yes, whether you are listening or not, they don’t bother about that and continue giving advice.', 'What kind of advice do they give. Whatever type of question is there currently, accordingly they would give advice.', 'See for me in my house the advices given are like “My child don’t go to the water”, “Come home before 11 o’clock in the night”, “Don’t roam about in the sun” and all. Here what kind of advices are given? Advices are like this itself, but nobody listens to.', 'Nobody listens to. No, nobody listens. All here are totally filmy style.', 'What is the reason for that? Just like that, like how is in movies.', 'Oh, they are getting spoiled by seeing movies. Yes. They are getting spoiled by watching movies.', 'Is there anything that parents or grandparents can do by which they would start listening to them? They also behave like how is in movies only. Totally everyone over here is following filmy style.', 'Okay, is it like that over here? See when you are visiting the community then you can see that 90 to 95 percent of boys over here who are of 15 to 20 years of age, in each of their hands will have phone of the kind which even we don’t have with us. It might be a China made phone, but still they have it. So all are filmy style.', 'Okay, here all the children have phone. But how about their parents? Do their parents also have phone? Yes. They also have.', 'Do they have android or the simple ones? Not android. They have simple phones.', 'The phones with buttons. Yes.', 'How they use the phone or what is the usage of phone over here? Only to make calls.', 'Only to make calls. Then how about children? Children uses it for playing games, internet and for Whatsapp.', 'Do they use internet? Yes.', 'How about camera and radio? Do they use those applications? Yes, they use all those applications.', 'So they know how to use these things? Yes. Everybody uses everything.', 'Do they use phones for getting jobs or work or for earning? No, they don’t use it for that. Mostly it is labor work over here. They get more income in doing labor than doing other jobs.', 'Is it like that? Yes.', 'Do the boys work? Only a few of them work.', 'Is that mean that there is no way to make them understand and advice ? No.', 'If they are applying little bit of intelligence by themselves, then only it will work. Yes. If it comes to them on their own.', 'Suppose there are 7 people in a family, then is there anyone outside their family who is important for them? There are so many problems that we cannot tell in the house or we ourselves cannot solve. Then if we are discussing with a person from outside, then we will get a better idea. Is there any such person with whom they speak regularly? In their community or caste there are some groups going on with a leader. So if leader is explaining to them, then things may work.', 'So they will listen to the leader. Yes, they will listen to him.', 'So it is only the leaders who can influence them from outside the family. Yes. Only the leader can do that.', 'Is it like that they will not refuse to the leader at any time? No, they will not say no because the leaders have the authority to decide whether a person is need to be kept in the community or outcaste him. So if he outcastes a person or a family, then neither the remaining people from the entire community will call or support them in any way nor they can come to the community after that. So they have this fear that if they are being outcasted from the community then they don’t have any other place to go. So if they are explained by taking advantage of this fear, then they will understand. Lot of people here are like dons.', 'Oh, is it so? That don culture is there. Only.', 'Can you explain little bit about what is it like? In this Tekra, area wise there are lot of dons in different area. For example for this area or the lower area, there was one don called Jigar who has been murdered recently about 2 or 3 months back. One month after the murder there was so many outrageous reactions and so many people has suffered so many loses. People’s vehicles are burned, glasses of vehicles are broken and houses of many people are also burned in all these. Such things are going on. There are many other dons like that.', 'So is that the don who is also the leader? No.', 'So he is not the same person. No.', 'Are the leaders good persons? As far as you are not troubling them, the leaders are good.', 'No, not like that. Are they the people who think for the benefit of the community or are they selfish? No, they think for the community. They do good for the community.', 'So they do good for the community, right? Yes, but as far they are not being cheated.', 'What do you mean by that, not being cheated means? Many times they have been provoked by telling them that somebody has told something like that about them, then they get angry. Otherwise they are not like that.', 'But these things must be happening, know? Yeah, it keeps happening.', 'Somebody or the other might be provoking them. yeah, Somebody or the other, when they are on opposite side, they keep provoking.', 'Are there any one who will never say no to the community people, for doing any work for them or if they need anything? No, nobody is like that.', 'Nobody? Like that there is Manav Sadhana which is open for everybody.', 'Generally what is the job over here? Mostly nobody does a job over here.', 'Job means not only the service, but what work people do generally? A few people go on contract basis for building work. Then another work done is cylinder service.', 'Cylinder means is it LPG gas cylinder? Yes, those gas cylinders, they work in that. And some are running Tempo vehicles like mini truck. Also there is another labor work of picking paper from garbage. Like the one which is there outside, people use to do the work of doing rounds with pedal rickshaw. For that they say the price per bag, so they decide like for one trip they would carry this much of luggage and this much money should be given. Also there are some who keeps roaming. Suppose if you are going to Jamalpur, Kalupur or Lal Darwaja, they will be standing there for lifting and transferring the luggage of the people.', 'For transportation, right? Yes, for transportation.', 'How much they must be earning in a day? Normally one person will be easily earning 1000 rupees per day.', 'Oh, is it so? He can earn 1000 rupees per day easily. Yes.', 'That means they are not in that much trouble for money. No, they don’t have monetary problems.', 'But I have heard like the people here are not interested in working and they just want to roam about. See it is like suppose a person is running pedal rickshaw. He rides the pedal rickshaw at night and pick papers from the garbage in the night. In the morning he sells off those material. He sells the materials of around 1000 rupees, so he doesn’t have the need to work during daytime. Even I don’t earn that much every day.', 'Okay, that means the entire way of thinking is different. Yes, the entire way of thinking is different.', 'So the 1000 rupees that he is earning everyday must be got spend, know. Yes, for them it gets spent.', 'How about the food? Normally how many times the food is cooked in a day? It is cooked in twice a day.', 'Oh, it is cooked twice in a day and what all will be there to eat? They eat heavy food.', 'What do you meant by heavy? Is it roti and Sabji? Roti and Sabji will be there, along with that they will get outside food also. Also people over here eat more of mutton and fish.', 'Okay, there is more of non-veg. Is it cooked every day? Not every day. But in a week 3 or 4 days it will be there for sure.', 'So if these people are using their daily earning on daily basis in this way, then if somebody is falling sick, then what would they do? If a person is getting normally sick, then there is no problem. Then they will go to a general doctor. But sometimes if someone is getting little more sick, then these people’s mentality is such that they go and admit in a big dispensary.', 'Okay. And for whatever expenditure they need to incur, they take loan from their neighborhoods.', 'Okay, so they take loan from their neighbors. So would they take it for interest ? Yes, they take it on interest and this interest is very heavy. It is double than the banks. I have seen people taking loans at even 10 percent interest.', 'Neighborhood means it could be the next door neighbor also? Yes, they take loan from anybody who is their neighborhood, the next door neighbor or anybody who they know.', 'Okay fine. So they are managing their problems by taking loan. Yes, they manage their problems.', 'As you told there are people who run Tempo vehicles or mini-trucks. Where do they get work from or how do they get work? Mostly for LPG gas transportation it is already allocated.', 'So they are fixed? For collecting papers from garbage also, it is allocated. And for some people there are allocated shops for collecting waste materials. For some people the dispensaries are also allocated like they have to transport whatever the waste materials are there from the dispensaries. Then there are people who work on contract basis. For them also the timing is fixed. The remaining local people would be there at Jamalpur or Kalupur.', 'And they will find somebody over there. Yes, they will somebody over there.', 'That means every day they have to search for the work, right. No, only a few people, like 20 percent, need to search for work. Rest 80 percent people have fixed work.', 'We see in the morning those 500 to 600 people. Where do they come from? Yes, \\xa0labors. They \\xa0come from various areas, \\xa0but mostly they are from here only.', 'Are they from Parishad Nagar only? Yes, \\xa0they are from here and also there are people who came from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, where there is not Gujarati language.', \"So then don't they have to search for the work everyday? Their work may not be allocated know? Those people have to reach to that place in morning between 8 o'clock to 9 o'clock. Contractors come there to select and take those people with them.\", 'Do all of them gets selected? Yeah, mostly they gets selected.', 'Does anybody comes back? People have to come back if there is no work.', 'How much do those contractors pay approximately? I have no idea.', 'See there are some agencies like placement agencies or NGOs which provide help to search for work. Do they take help from agencies like this? No.', 'No, then what is the reason for that? The community over here asks always for more money. They want less work, but more money which is not possible.', 'Suppose if Manav Sadhna helps them to get the job, then do they feel like they are paid less. Yes.', 'Do they trust these institutions? Yes. They trust them completely..', 'Okay. So they trust them completely. Do they have a bank account? Yes, they must be having a bank account.', 'In each and every house? Yeah, in each and every house must be having.', 'Do each and every person has account? No, not per person. In a house one or two people must be having an account because mostly about 100 percent of people is having a vehicle.', 'Vehicle means two wheeler? Two wheeler or it can be a Tempo. So they have taken loans and therefore everybody must be having an account.', 'Okay. Account is opened for taking the loan.', 'Then other day-to-day transactions will be in cash only. Yes, \\xa0they do cash transaction for that.', 'Do they do saving or deposit in the bank? No, \\xa0no savings or deposit. They only pay installments.', 'Ok, doing installment is fine. But I am asking that do they do savings or deposit? No savings. Hardly 10 percent people might be there who do savings.', 'Okay, only 10 percent. Then rest all don’t do , right? No.', 'Okay. We use to see persons who would be earning around 1000 rupees per day which will be finished in the same day itself. And in the next day he might be asking money from his friends saying that “Give me 20 rupees. I want to drink alcohol”.', 'Oh, is it so? He also tells that he will give it back in the evening.', 'So here there is lot of importance for bars serving alcohols. Yes.', 'Do they drink by making it from home itself? No, they go to bar.', 'So it is there in each and every house. So how about ladies? Do they drink? There are about 5 percent of ladies who eat Gutkha.', 'Gutkha? Yes, that masala.', 'No alcohol? No, no alcohol.', 'Only men are having alcohol. Yes.', 'How about boys? Boys also do drinking.', 'Oh. Boys are also there. Yes. I have seen many boys, who are not even 15 years old, eating that masala and drinking alcohol.', 'Do they take insurances like accident insurance or Life Insurance? When they buy two wheeler on loan, they automatically get insurance on that.', 'Yeah, that is there. But how about life insurance? No, nothing like that.', \"How about those skill development schemes from the government, Like teaching stitching to ladies, garage work or electronic work for boys? Government provide schemes like this, so do they take advantage of these schemes? Lot of schemes come. \\xa0But these people don't use them.\", 'Oh. They are not using. No, \\xa0no only about 5 percent people must be using it.', 'Do they ever come to know about it? They know about it.', \"Then what is the reason for not using it? They are doing labor work and get more income by doing that over here. So they don't want to pay attention on anything else.\", \"They don't want to do anything else ? Always they think about their own benefits first.\", 'Because of these schemes they will get benefit, know. Yes, but in that their time will be wasted know.', 'Yes, \\xa0for that much period they will not be getting income. Yes, they will not be getting income.', 'How about the sugar quantity used in the food of these people? It is more.', 'Is it more? They like sweet and spicy food.', 'Sweet and spicy, \\xa0both. So these people must not have eaten anything without sugar. No, it will not do.', 'In what type of food do they use sugar? All tasty food and sweets.', 'For example, \\xa0if it is tea, then sugar is used in that. Yes. In tea, sugar is used.', 'Like that which are the other things? Do they make sweet every day? Tea and sweets, but it is not made every day. But, they make sweets if they are having some guests.', 'Then in what all things they are making every day, like roti and Sabji, dal rice or the things that you said just now, in which of them they use more sugar? They use sugar when they are making one Sabji which is the Sabji using mango. They use sugar in pickles.', 'Do they eat pickle? Yes.', 'What are the things included in their normal meal ? I was not aware about that they use pickle in their meals. Which are the other things they have in their meal? There are different types of \\xa0pickles. There are five to six varieties of pickles for them. Many people put sugar in dal when they are having dal rice.', 'To make it sweet? Yes, to make sweet dal. There is no other things. Also when the children feels the food as spicy, \\xa0they add sugar in that as well.', 'Is it okay for them to not to have sugar or is it mandatory for them to have sugar? No, \\xa0they need sugar.', 'Okay. Every day the tea is made at least 5 to 6 times in their houses.', 'Oh, is it 5 to 6 times? Yes, it is like that.', 'How about drinking bland tea without sugar? Nobody has such habit.', 'Do they know that if you are reducing or totally stopping sugar ,then it is beneficiary for your body? Yes, they know.', \"So they know about it and they are not giving importance to that. Yes, they don't give importance to that.\", \"Then what could be the reason for that? He knows but he don't want to follow that. What could be the reason for that? Many people think like that they have their own desires and they don't want to control that. Eating means eating and that is it.\", 'Suppose if somebody is falling sick, \\xa0then doctor must be giving advice to them, right? Yes , they give advice.', 'Do they observe those? They observe, but only for temporary.', 'Only for that much time? Yes, \\xa0it is temporary. \\xa0Just for the sake of saying they observe those for some time only. Recently there was a patient to whom the doctor has advised to have eggs because of his disease. So doctor told him that “You must eat eggs”. But then he replied that “We cannot eat eggs because of spiritual reasons”. So doctor asked him that “If you cannot eat eggs as you are a spiritual person, then how about alcohol. Is it allowed?”', 'Yeah, that is true. Then he said “That we can drink”. Then the doctor asked like “How you can drink that. If you can drink alcohol, then you can have egg also.”', 'After that he ate or not? Yeah, it is going on.', 'No, did he eat eggs? Yes, afterwards he ate.', 'That means they are listening at least to the doctors. Yeah, they listen to doctor.', 'Is this about PoonamBhai clinic ? Yes, \\xa0it is about that clinic.', 'Suppose if anybody from the community or you are telling them to stop or reduce the usage of sugar, then will they listen to it? There will not stop it, but may reduce it.', 'Will they reduce? If they are made scared by saying that ”When you are using so much sugar or not reducing sugar, then you will have diabetes”. Then they may reduce or use other things instead of sugar.', 'What do you mean by these other things, for example? Nowadays we use to see those ads which shows that we can use Sugar Free.', 'Yeah, that tablet. So they drop sugar.', 'Can they afford such things? Yes, they can afford because per day a person earns about 1000 rupees and the full amount will not be spent in a day. Also many things like ration kit are bought monthly only. Whereas there are other things like milk, vegetables and all which are brought daily. Also some cereals, they bring and store it for whole year.', 'Oh, so they store it for the whole year? Yes, for example, things like wheat, millets, dal, rice, are stored for the whole year.', 'Isn’t it so like they bring the things, like oil and other things, every day as they earn every day? No, it is not like that. It is only for a few. Those who do the work of rag picking have the habit of purchasing things for every day.', 'Those people do everyday purchases? Out of that also, only 20 percent will bring their things for every day.', 'Okay. Because for them at first day get the income, \\xa0and after that they go and purchase the things for them.', 'Okay. So according to you it is difficult for them to leave sugar, right? Yes, it is very difficult.', 'So in a day what are the times or occasions they are having sugar? You just said that they will have tea for 4 to 5 times in a day and also while eating food. Yes, for tea and while eating.', 'Is there any other place like outside or like that from where they can’t leave sugar? Yes, like if they go out to somebody’s house, the first thing served is sweets. So like this they cannot leave sugar.', 'Then they are having the addiction of betel leaves and tobacco in which also they use sugar, right. Yes.', 'But that they will not be able to leave. No, that \\xa0they will not be able to leave.', 'It is very difficult. Last time to leave their addiction of Gutkha, pan masala and alcohol , 5 to 6 people were admitted at the hospital. They had to stay there for 6 months to get over those addictions. They have come out clean also. And out of that one person, after he changed, has been put on job as well. And because of his friend, he has started again.', 'He has started, so that means they don’t have control over themselves. No, no control. And mostly it is because of the peer pressure from their friend circle. They push or tell them to have it.', 'So here there exist a fear of the community, companion or friend, right. Yes, that is there.', 'So using that fear, it is possible to do things to bring them on track. Yes, we can do that.', 'They must not have even tried know, to make tea without sugar or to stop using sugar. No, they must not have done that.', 'Never? No, Never.', 'Then when you are having camps over here, then that time do you tell them about it that the sugar should be stopped ? Yes, we use to tell them to stop using sugar.', 'When has it happened? In a year one or two camps are done. There will be one general camp and sometimes before there was the diabetes camp. Before that eyes camp was there for eyes check up. So we keep telling them in all these camps.', 'Suppose we are explaining to them and they are agreeing to that, then will they be able to take decision to stop the sugar forever? Yes, they may decide. But they may not be able to follow.', 'That means they will take decision and it doesn’t mean that they will leave it forever. Yeah, then there is no use of it.', 'So till now they have no idea about food without sugar. No, you can visit the kitchen and check right now when the food is cooked.', 'Is it down there? No, opposite only. Then you will get an idea about how the food is cooked.', 'Do they do exercise or anything or no? They do, but just for copying each other.', 'Is it that way? Yes, it is that way', 'Do they do it at home? They do it. But not at home. Here gym is there. Right now, there are around 70 boys in that.', '70 boys. Oh, okay. In morning and in evening.', 'Copying each other means what type of copying? Suppose a movie has come and in that if there is a change in body  and somebody else has a body like that and that person is doing exercises, then seeing that person they will go to do exercises to make their body like that.', 'This people may be having an idea that doing exercise is beneficiary to body. Everybody knows.', 'Still there are only 70 of them that’s it. Yes', 'Nobody else. No. We shifted many of them to gym given by municipal cooperation .', 'Is it at Nava Vadaj? Yes, at Nava Vadaj.', 'How much must be the population there? Lot of population.', 'Suppose you want to  say one number approximately. I cannot even say any approximate number.', 'So population is a lot know, out of that hardly 70 to 100 people only come for doing exercises right? Yes', 'What is the reason for others for not to do exercises? Everybody is busy in doing their labor work right from the morning. Because for some labor work they have to reach around 8’o clock  in the morning from their house and in evening they come home being tired and so they drink alcohol and go to sleep .', 'And what you say that they are going for labor. So doing that labor work do they have any physical work to do? Yes, they do.', 'Everyone ? Yes, it’s there for everyone.', 'Suppose if you, any committee worker over here, any doctor or somebody tells them or explains to them like doing physical work or exercise 30 minutes every day is good for your body and in future you will not have many diseases, then will they listen to it? At that time when they are told they would listen, but after that they will not adhere to. There are very few.', 'They will not do? No, they will not do.', 'Is there any way by which we can encourage them to do exercises? We have to find ways to encourage them because encouragement is very important for them.', 'What kind of encouragement can be give them? First of all, we have to prepare them mentally. Then only they will be physically ready. Because we have done lot of camps. If we are telling them that it is like a general camp and you will get free medicine or something then only they will come. Suppose we think that 100 people will come, because we won’t be able to judge how many people would turn up. Sometimes more than 100 or sometimes 200 or sometimes even 500 would turn up. But if we say about one particular camp, for example, diabetes camp then 100 also will not turn up. They have a thought that what would do if diabetes is detected in me.', 'So that is good know. Early detection is good. Their mentality is just opposite. All their food will be stopped, also some people will keep distance from them .', 'Is it so? Yes', 'Oh, they thinking completely opposite. Yeah, they are thinking opposite.', 'I’m talking about encouragement like, for example, yesterday when I was talking to somebody then that person told me that if we tell them they don’t come directly. But if we go and do street plays or make their children do those plays then they come to see that and they would start coming over here. Yes, that can be done.', 'So like that, is there something that you have done or in your thought. Is there anything like that? Yeah, that can be done like dance and drama, not in street play. But if we keep dance, drama or any other activity here, then a lot of public will come to see that. So that time you can talk about it.', 'Then, would we get good response with that? Yes, we would get.', 'Will they come for camps? Yes, they would come.', 'Then, suppose you did a camp and you told them a lot of things like you should do this or that. Then, do you do follow up for them? Yes. We do follow up. But they didn’t give response from their side.', 'What do you mean by they don’t give response? Suppose a person have some sickness, then we go to their place every day and he takes medicines for 4 days and in 5th day when we are going there to give medicine, that person will not be there in the house. These people say like that if a person becomes seriously sick then they change their place.', 'What do you mean by changing the place? They change the place from here and shift to village. They think that if the atmosphere is changed, then the person will become alright faster.', 'Do they come back or they don’t come back? They come back, but after very long time.', 'Now, you told about medicines right. See I’m like this if I fall sick then we will go to dispensary, then doctor gives medicines. He gives medicine for 15 days and if I become alright in 5 days, I stop having medicine. Is it that way over here? Yes, they leave. It is that way over here.', 'Do they feel they are given extra medicines by doctor to make them spend more? Do they feel that way? Yes, it is like that.', 'They stop on their own. They don’t try to complete the course. No, they don’t complete the course. But nowadays doctors have changed the way of giving medicines. Previously they used to give medicines for long time, but now they have changed it to daily medicines.', 'Daily medicines means they have to come every day. Yes, they have to come every day.', 'Do they come? Yes, they come.', 'But then after that when they become alright then they don’t come. Is it so they stop? Yes, they stop.', 'Because usually there is a course. Suppose it is for 15 days, they give it because it is necessary to have medicine for 15 days. Yes.', 'But now if you are doing it on daily basis and if they are becoming alright in 5 days and not coming on 6th day, then his course will be left half way. That anyhow is going to happen. Even if we give them at home, he will not take.', 'Still he will not take. No.', 'Then, what is the reason for making it like on daily basis? Because of that we come to know whether the person is taking medicine every day or not. If he is taking medicine regularly then he would come to take medicines. If he is not taking, then he would not turn up.', 'Okay. There is one girl who had TB. She was very young of 16 or 17 years old. In first stage, her medicines are going on ,50% medication was completed and 50% was pending. She has already started to become alright because in TB when you take medication for few days, then recovery happens. When people stop taking medicines, then after sometime TB happens again with twice stronger than before. Because once recovered and if TB is coming again, then it comes in with double force. So, she got TB again and then again she started medicines. She took medicine for 15 days and again it recovered. Again she dropped the medication. Now she has got TB as a lifelong disease. Now, she has to go to take medicines every time after certain intervals. Now, she is having breathing problems. She takes less of breath due to very low pressure. Because of that she comes once or twice in a week to the dispensary. Now she has to take medicines for longer period of time.', 'So she has to take medicines for long period of time Yes, now she has to take medicines for longer period of time, which she had to take for only six months before. After already continuing taking medicines for three months, there was only three months remaining. If she were doing like that before, she would have become alright now forever. But now, her medication will go on for long period of time.', 'You go to hospital. So according to you what type of diseases are the most prevailing. Normally fever, cough cold, vomiting and loose motion.', 'Fever, cough cold, vomiting and loose motion. These are normal.', 'These are normal. Also people with injuries.', 'Like scratch kind of a thing. Yes, little bit of hurt, little bit of scratch like that.', 'So, you don’t see any serious illness. No.', 'So TB or cancer are less prevailing or is it not at all there? There are patients with TB .Lot of people come. But we only do checkup. And after checkup we sent them to civil. It is a big hospital over here.', 'Civil means is it  the one which is near to VS No , VS is on that side and civil is on this side', 'Ok You must have gone with Ramana Bhai may be. Civil  hospital is very big hospital of Ahmedabad. We sent them there or else there is another center over here.', 'Where? Red cross.', 'In which area it is located? Once we come out from Ashram and get down, then go little further. It is there only.', 'Do you sent them to civil which have shifted to highway, the new one? Did you sent them there? No', 'Do you know there is a new civil just before the high court? Not there', 'Where the old one is there. Over there? Yes, at the old one. They do checkups there and in the evening they transfer the list of medicines with the list of patients over here. The HR comes at our dispensary for three days. And they give the medicines to everybody.', 'You said HR. What do you mean by HR? There is one member that they have kept for TB people. He comes every day. No, every day means he comes three times a week. They themselves remove strips and give medicine it in the hands of patient. And patients have to consume medicine in front of them. And if patient doesn’t come, then he has to go to his house. They already have  the list and contact number with them.', 'All these are done by government? Yes, this is from government', 'Normally, which are the different type of diseases that you saw in people over here? Mostly all.', 'All means, can you name a few? Normally fever, cough cold, vomit, loose motion, stomach pain, joint pain, cancer, so and so I have seen. The TB case already we have seen. One or two patients of HIV.', 'Do you have any idea about what are chronic disease is? No', 'Like diabetes. You must be having idea of diabetes Yes, that I know', 'Do people know about it? Yes, people know about it.', 'How much do they know about it? They know that, when we are eating certain food, will cause diabetes and what happens because of that. They know that much.', 'So which are the things when we are eating, will cause diabetes? First it is sweet. Mostly people know that much only. If  we eat sweet things diabetes happen.', 'Don’t they know about which part of the body get affected? No, they don’t know that much.', 'So, what are the precautions to be taken? Don’t they know? No, they don’t know.', 'You said about the camp done for diabetes. So what was done at that time? See those who came here have an idea about how and what are the thing that harms them. They have that idea. Suppose thousands of people are there in community, but out of them hardly 100 people came here. Only those 100 people will know that eating this can cause these problems or diseases. Rest of them doesn’t know because they didn’t come to camp. In general camps everyone use to come, but we cannot do all these things at that time as the time is limited.', 'How much of diabetes is prevailing in this community? I don’t have any idea, even approximately.', 'Do you get cases like that? Do they come in dispensary? Yeah, they come.', 'How many such cases must be there? In one month,  two or three patients come like that.', 'You get to see two to three patients? Yes.', 'Is it possible that, they have diabetes and we don’t have any idea about it because of the fact that they are not coming here? Yes, that is possible', 'Ok, so it is possible like that. People must be having diabetes over here. Yes, they must be having. I told you know that here people’s mentality is very different. It is just the opposite. So they don’t want to do even checkups. They must be having, but they won’t do checkup. They only will know about it when they are becoming seriously ill. Because at that time when the checkups are done, they would come to know about that also. Still they will not inform to anyone. Even if they go to another dispensary they will not tell that I have this problem.', 'So is diabetes, a serious disease? yes', 'Ok, so it is a serious disease. Then these people must be having an idea about what other diseases the diabetes will leads to? They must be having the idea.', 'So if a person is getting diabetes, then which are the other problems that can crop up due to that? Yes, they have an idea. Those who have come to the camp and those who go to the dispensary, know about it.', 'So, rest of them have no idea about it. Rests of them have no idea about it.', 'So they have no idea about it like reasons and all, except the name. Name everybody knows, right. Yes, everybody knows the name.', 'Then what they know is that it happens because of sugar. Yes, they have that much idea.', 'Nothing else. No, nothing else.', 'Then, at least they must be knowing that if we are taking medication , the diabetes can be cured. Yes.', 'You told that children use phones. Then, monthly  approximately how much do they spend on phone. They use phone for internet and charges. Normally, one boy must be spending around 3000.', 'Monthly 3000, is it so? Yes', 'So much of amount. Yes.', 'And how about parents? How much do they spend approximately? They spend very less on phone call. They must be managing within 500. Because they have no idea about different schemes. They just do normal balance and use it.', 'So they use it only for making calls. Yes.', 'And nobody is using phone to get a job or employment. No, nobody is using that.', 'How about children? Do they have all types of fascination? Yes, they have all types of fascination.', 'Here, a lot of people come to do survey, right. Like how we have come, like that a lot of other people also must be coming to Manav Sadhna. Also there are some surveys done by companies. Suppose you bought something, then you would receive a call from them asking us what is your opinion about that. Or else you would receive a message. So, suppose if a company have sent a message like that, then will they reply back to this message ? Yes, they will do.', 'See they don’t get any advantage out of it. The company is only asking, since the company is doing a survey. So they ask like as you came here or as you have bought something from here, what was your experience about it? They would say to reply on the same number. Then, will they reply? Normally here, the company numbers starts from 1400. So, when they see a company call, they will reject it beforehand itself.', 'Oh, do they cut it? Yes, they won’t receive the call itself.', 'So, they don’t receive itself. So, there is no need of question for replying to the SMS. No, they will not reply.', 'But suppose if it is like a free SMS and if it have been written that if you are replying not a single rupee, of yours’s, will be deducted as this is only for our record. Then, will they reply? No, still they will not reply.', 'Then, when we call to customer care, then you know that a recording comes like “For English press one, for some other press two”. Like that if somebody asks “How was your experience. For good press one and for bad press two”. Since they have to press just one or two ,will they reply or disconnect? Still in most cases, they will not reply.', 'They will not reply? Even children will not reply? Nobody will reply.', 'At last if we make a call and ask them. Will they reply or for that also they will not reply? Then, they may reply.', 'Then they may reply. Then if it is a number beginning with 1, will they reply? No, they will not reply.', 'Which phone do they use the most over here? Mostly people use Samsung, Nokia. In a family, people use Nokia. Then, those local phones and China phones are used the most.', 'Who is the network provider like Vodafone, Idea, Uninore? For calling and SMS, everyone is using Uninore', 'Everybody? Mostly. Because Uninore gives highest number of facilities for calling. Almost as good as free rates. The other one is Idea. Those who are from outside, like from UP or Bihar, use Idea. Vodafone is used very less by people, because they only use those from where they are getting good scheme. Mostly they purchase those cards.', 'What is their life like? How do they spend a whole day? For those who are doing job use less of phone calls. And those who are free whole day, they use net, WhatsApp and songs. They are crazy about it.', 'What types of people are free? Like for example ladies ,male or children of particular age are free or is it grandparents? Grandparents are always free. They get up in the morning , freshen up, have tea and breakfast and then go back to sleep. Then, get up at the time of lunch. They have their lunch and would go back to sleep. In the evening, they get up and visit to anybody’s house in the nearby place to just sit there. And ladies in the house also have this kind of schedule only. In morning they would get up early, they have to make tea and breakfast and serve. Then they have household work. Then would make lunch and then in the afternoon they are free. They might go to sleep and in the evening  would get up and go to do their regular work.', 'When do they go to do  work outside? 50% of them don’t go for work.', 'Ladies? Yes, ladies. There are only some who go for work.', 'Then, how about males? All of them go for work.', 'Ok, all of them go for work? Yes. Those who are married would go. Those who are unmarried and are not going to school, keep roaming the whole day.', 'How do they manage their expenditure? Do they take from their parents? Yes, they take from their parents.', 'Now, you told that here there is too much of drinking alcohol. So, does that create any problem in this community? Yes, it creates. Because the thing is that when a person drinks alcohol, he has no senses. They don’t see who is there in front of you. Because of that lot of outrage or fights happen. But that happens due to certain people only, all are not like that. I have seen a lot of people who drink alcohol in extreme quantity but nobody would even come to know that this person have drunk alcohol. They go home, eat and would go to sleep, and nothing else.', 'Is it something over here that in the night after a particular time, one should not go out? Yes, it is there. In certain area in line, these kind of things are there.', 'Like ladies have to take care or small children should not go out, because they must be troubled. Is it so? Nobody troubles but as I told you, if the person is provoked then it happens. Otherwise nothing happens.', 'Does it happened many a  times that the person is provoked? Yes, it happens.', 'That girl may be teased. Yes, these kinds of things happen at many places. And because of that many fight also happens. And when that happens, it is very fearsome that it could go up to such an extent that the opposite person might get killed. It goes to that extent. It happens only if provocation is done, otherwise not.', 'Normally in everybody’s house what kind of electronic devices would be there? The once that run on electricity. Normally all kind of electronic devices.', 'For example? Like TV, fridge, CD, DVD, sound system. In every ones house, you can see these.', 'Fridge also Yes, fridge also. Even ACs have started now.', 'Ok In around the area of Manav Sadhna, almost five houses have ACs.', 'The phone is a must. Yes, phone is must.', 'In phone do they have land line? No, land line.', 'All are mobiles. Long time before, there were land lines over here. But in between they started cutting of the wires and sell it off.', 'Ok. It happens sometimes with channel wires also. They cut of the wires and sell it off outside.', 'So, do they keep the dish TV? They have channel and dish also.', 'And, is there any stealing of electricity done? Yes, it’s done fully.', 'Is it so, fully? Yes, it is possible, because many of them are working in Torrent or many are electricians. So, they know how to do.', 'How much of the population is doing this approximately? I can’t say it approximately. But we can say that monthly they get 50 to 70 rupees of extra charges.', 'Is it from Torrent? Yes, per house.', 'Is it here around this area? Yes, each house is getting that much extra load. It is like this, suppose from outside one cable one meter comes, which is the main cable. One sub-station is made for that. From there it is distributed to different areas.', 'ok Ok. Now, out of that stealing is done by one person. So the main meter which is there outside shows his extra bill. Now, by seeing that meter, the Torrent people would say that the electricity has gone from here, but we don’t have idea about who has used it. So, the charges of electricity are distributed to each and every one. So that extra charges are coming to everyone.', 'So, one house gets extra charge of 50 rupees. Is it so? Yes.', 'Ok. So, here there must be so many house know. How many houses are there approximately? I don’t have that much of idea about it. Because recently, many buildings are constructed.', 'Do they have laptop, computer or tablet in anyone’s house? Yes, it is there.', 'Even tablet? Yes, tablet is also there.', 'But such houses must be very few? Yes, very few houses. Computer would be there in many people’s houses. But laptops are there with a very few. Only those who are doing job must be having.', 'How many people are doing job? Hardly 20 percent, in whole Tekra.', '20 percent? Yes, 20 percent are doing job. They are doing marketing job. By doing marketing they get good salary. Or they must be in reliance or in any other good posts.', 'Then, what is the reason for them to stay here? They have stayed here right from their childhood. So, they like here, the atmosphere and so everybody stays here.', 'They like here means, do everybody stay and  socially mingle with each other? Yes, everybody mingles with each other.', 'If there is any worries then will they be able to share with the people from neighborhood or the relatives? They support, they can share.', 'Or is it like that since we are staying in a house, the things should  remain in the house itself and should not be known to outside ? No, it is not like that. They share with each other.', 'Do they celebrate festivals or not? Yes, they do.', 'So, in a year how many festivals do they celebrate? That would be a long list.', 'Long list means many festivals. Yes, many festivals. Almost all festivals they celebrate.', 'Do they celebrate together? Yes, everybody together.', 'Which are the other social activities that  they do? Socially they would do ,whatever has been told in Mandal.', 'I did not understand what is Mandal? Mandal is a kind of unity that they have to keep. In short they say as Mandal. Like how we just spoke about the leader position, in Mandal there would be one leader. That’s it. In that ,whatever they decide that only happens. For example, when marriages are conducted, what they would do is marriages of the full community is done together, like a mass marriage. Like that they do other programs also. They have Bajan Mandal also. Like these they will be together . Also they celebrate festivals.', 'So like these the programs are done, where everybody gathers together and enjoys the celebration. Yeah,  these kinds of programs are done by this people', 'One you said is Bajans. Which are the other things they do, of that kind? Bajans is there. Also they have this mass marriages. Sometimes if they want to keep meetings, if they want to say something, if somebody needs money in the Mandal, to help somebody', 'One you said is Bajans. Which are the other things they do, of that kind? And also they collect their own particular collection like a type of fund, in their own Mandal. So anytime any one is in need, then they can use that fund.', 'That is very good. Yeah, that is very good.', 'Do they have the tradition of visiting to each other’s house just to sit there? Yes, they go to each other’s house.', 'Is everyone or only 5 to 10 percent of people are like that? Mostly everyone is going.', 'Like that if somebody has visited, then do they give them food, any drinks or just chit chat is done? They will feed them fully.', 'Would they have meals? Yes, they would do meals.', 'So at that time what do they cook? I told you those things. Sweet is always made. And if they eat non-veg, then along with that non-veg will definitely be there.', 'If the person has come to just sit there for 2 to 3 hours, then will they give them tea and snacks? Yes, tea and snacks are given.', 'Do everybody makes tea only or is there any other things? Everybody makes tea.', 'Isn’t it like sometimes they may give juice or ice cream? That is very less. For the person who doesn’t have tea or if the person says that “I don’t want tea”, then the next choice is juice.', 'How about ice cream or snacks? Nothing like that ? No, not those things. Tea is a must. There is a second option only when the person doesn’t want tea. Tea is the first option.', 'Which language do the people over here know? Normally there is Gujarati.', 'Okay. Gujarati. That also, only the vocal language.', 'Not reading and writing? Very few people know to read and write. The elder people in the house….', 'Don’t they know Hindi? They know Hindi, but they cannot speak it fluently.', 'How about reading and writing? They cannot even speak the pure Gujarati properly. They speak the simple vocal language.', 'What were you saying about the elderly people? Those who are elderly people can only speak, whereas those who are educated can speak Hindi and Gujarati properly.', 'You said that 3 generations stay together. Now we spoke about grandparents. Which language do the in between generation, like parents,  know? This only. They know Gujarati and Hindi.', 'Do they know Hindi ? Mostly everybody knows Hindi. But they cannot speak it fluently. They can listen and understand, but cannot speak in a good flow.', 'They cannot read and write. That is not there.', 'If we are coming to one more generation down, then? They know how to read and write.', 'Gujarati? Gujarati and Hindi. They know both.', 'How about English or don’t they know English? English is not there that much.', 'Okay. Have you seen anything different in this community, as you are staying here for so many years? Like have you felt like this is something different? Do you have anything like that in your mind? No, I don’t have any such thing in my mind.', 'Very nice. Thank you so much. Thank you.', 'If there is anything more, then I will call you and will ask you. It will not be this way. When I am going through this again and if some question arises, then I will call you and ask you. Okay.', 'If there is anything more, then I will call you and will ask you. It will not be this way. When I am going through this again and if some question arises, then I will call you and ask you. Is it ok, if here people keep coming and going?', 'No, no problem. As far as it is capturing voice, there is no problem. How many years are you working with Manav Sadhna? I have joined with Manav Sadhna many years back, in the years 2003 and 2004. And for one and half years I am working voluntarily with Manav Sadhna and from there I got lot of support from Anaar Dhidhi. So by doing all that I have worked with almost all NGOs. And now, I’m working with Rudra Center. My journey is now 10 to 12 years old.', 'Okay, 12 years almost. Now, you are an employee here? Yes, now I’m working here as a worker.', 'Which are the projects now you are attached with? Right now, there is a social part of our Gramshree organization called Rudhra Mahila Udhar Kendra. I’m mainly attached there working for ladies where we give training of embroideries, weaving and we make them do yoga. We work on health issues and I’m working with that. There are 2 to 3 other works also. Like right now, we have a collaboration with Stanford University in which we are working on how to impart value based education to people. Also whenever we sit in a group discussion, mostly people don’t talk much about money. They say our research is going on. We are working on it for last 5 to 7 years on this and in that most of the people focus on the fact that only values help for the betterment of the world. We can earn money anyhow. But when the one who has money is supporting the other and the other person is supporting the next, like that people can be helpful to each other to make them stand on their own. But the most needed thing for this world is value based education. So how do we share that way each other and also one person can’t do everything. But if each person thinks for the betterment of the world and thinks that what is my statement in that, like what is that I want to do for the betterment of the world and how to do that. And like this we can take humanity forward. We are doing research on that. So, we are working on that one project and that has a part called Swa Gang in which there are three people from here and three people from there. They are either students or professors amongst us. We have a project which is a course of 10 months where we have to do our own journey. Also, we are working with young girls those who are teenagers from the age of 13 to 19. They have lot of problems. Many a times they have become overconfident, after we have taught them self-defense and sometimes that also becomes a problem. So, we want a kind of curriculum to be developed, where there is a combination of value as well as physical training. Because here, we are working for betterment of ladies and that doesn’t mean that we become anti-men. We don’t want to put any such thing to their mind at all. So right now, all these things like these works and these projects are in progress. So this is what going on.', 'So, you said that when girls are taught self-defense, then they become over confident. Is it that they become anti men? Is it so? So the problem starts increasing. Because there is no fault on girls regarding that. Because for many years they are seeing these problems happening more in slum areas. They are very good people but there are addicted people also who drink and spread violence. So they have in their mind that we also want to learn fighting so we can also fight with them and protect ourselves. From so many generations these girls are brought up like “This can be done by girls and that thing can be done by boys, girls are not supposed to do this and particular things can only be done by boys”. So, they grew up with that type of mind set. So, when they get this weapon that now we can also fight. They felt that fighting and self-saving is job of boys and taking our care is also the job of boys. But now they feel like we know fighting and we can do it ourselves. Because of this, this thing enters to their mind in a very innocent way. So, we want that there should not be having violence in whatever it is happening.', 'That means you are very familiar with the people in this community. Yes, because I have been brought up there, know. I was born and brought up there. And that is one of the reasons why I chose to do this work. Because my attention is always on the way of approach, like whatever things are happening, in that what is our approach to look at it and how do we think about it. And our entire life is running on that. So, I feel like the society is carrying the problems or the customs  which are not good and if good thoughts are developing in me, then why shouldn’t I share it with the society. I don’t have expectations that the society will change or the people will change. But I need my own satisfaction that at least I have tried and not like eating, drinking, and finishing the life only for myself. When I am taking my last breath I need the satisfaction that in my life I had given some contribution to the world and not like only lived for myself.', 'If everybody is starting to think like that then there will not be the need for change. I want to know about the problems that you said now that there are problems which you want to change. So I have some questions about the people in the community. I will ask you line by line. So if you have some problem or question in your mind, please tell. Okay.', 'Normally, in one house how many people stay over here? 5 to 7', 'Ok, 5 to 7. And how many generations will there? 2 to 3 generations would definitely there.', 'Meaning? Grandparents would be there. Parents would be there and their kids would be there. And many times if children would grow up, then their kids would also be there.', 'Ok, that means is it possible that there are 4 generations also? 3 to 4 generations would be there, but now in the recent generations who are of my age, there is only two or three generations.', 'Okay. Then in one family, on an average approximately how many children would be there? Three to five children would definitely be there.', 'Ok, three to five would be there. Yes.', 'See they have this big family staying together. So in one house there must be happening some small tiffs or problems and they will not be able to talk in the house internally. Then do they open their heart outside to somebody or they just suffer within themselves? It is so that they find their way out within themselves to solve the tiffs. They will find the way like many a times they had shown aggression in their behavior like speaking with anger or something like that. But here there is this kind of culture that either in the evening or in the afternoon whenever they get some time, they make groups among themselves  and sit together. And also they share their problems with the group with which they are comfortable to sit with and say that “See, I have this certain problem”', 'Then are those people from house only or there are people from neighborhood also? It is not necessary that those people should be from the same house. There would be people from the neighborhood also. With whom so ever they feel comfortable with, they share with them.', 'Is it okay if I speak in Guajarati? Okay.', 'If we consider a house, then who is the smartest of everybody? Smartest ? This is very difficult question.', 'Why it is difficult? We never bring it in our mind that somebody is not smart.', 'Smart means not like smart in studies. You told me like that only.', 'No, smart in worldliness and practicality. In practicality and worldliness, I feel ladies are smarter.', 'Ladies are smarter? Yes.', 'Yes, I wanted to know that. Because, this is my observation that I’m not giving a general statement, that in whatever I have seen, gents use to go in the morning, earn and come back in the evening. When everything is ready, they eat and sleep. And some of them would be socializing. But it is very practical in ladies, as they think a lot about future. If you focus on negative points then there will be lot of practical side also. Suppose you are staying in a joint family and if there is one lady who talks with negative energy. But behind that their thought will be about the security of their child like “If my husband is only working hard and is spending behind somebody else then what is my security?”. That keeps going on in her mind. So you can see this situation in positive way also. She is not wrong in her feelings but only her way of expression is different.', 'Okay. Do they have bonding amongst themselves like between husband and wife or mother and father or mother and son, like that or you don’t see it much? Here I have seen that the bonding is very solid in the slums. 80 percent or may be 90 percent is like that. Whether they are having time or not, they have very strong bonding of parents with their children.', 'Isn’t it here like it is 12’o clock in the night, so you have to come back early in the night or do they allow them to do whatever they want to do or children eat whatever they want to eat? Yes. Yes. It is there. Mothers are very dominating. Even if the children are of your age or married, still they will be dominating and will say that you have to come at this time compulsorily. “Why you are out?” It is like that. There are some who don’t believe that or believe less. But I have noticed that majority of people over here have very strong bonding.', 'That means majority of children listen to their parents. Yes, except for those who are trapped in addiction or  bad company. They may listen less or may not listen. But all the other people except those have very strong bonding.', 'Then, how many must be those kinds of people? There must be around 20 percent of people of that type.', 'Those who are in addiction or like that? I don’t know about addiction. Those who don’t listen are around 20 percent. Because when we go to do survey from house to house, and if there is gents in the house, then they would say like “Mother is not at home. Can you ask when she comes back home?” or “I will ask my mother and tell” or “Ask when my wife comes home”. So like that they have very strong bonds. But it may not be there in all the matters. In day to day life there may be thousands of questions or thousands of events or thousands of situations, right. So in all those situations it is not possible to listen or do whatever they are told to do. But where there is emotional level, there I have seen that they are very attached with each other.', 'Okay. They are attached to each other. Suppose the small advices like that “You come home early”, “Don’t eat this thing”, as here there is too much of importance for company if it is told “Don’t roam with this person”, since parents would be knowing what kind of person he is. Then do the children listen to these kinds of things or do they have to be forced by parents or they don’t listen to it at all? Because the poor parents over here mainly have to worry about what they would eat in the morning and in the evening.', 'Yes. That is their worry. So, they are busy in earning. They go in the morning, do the labor work and they have their own social commitments. That is also going on. So how much ever they tell their children, at the end they feel that if they are not listening what can I do. So they give up very easily.', 'Yes. They give up so easily. Yes, they give up and think like “Okay, let it be”. Also many children make their parents feel like that we are not eating anything wrong. But they are eating Gudkha and things like that. So these things are also going on.', 'Has it come to your notice at any time or is there any event that comes in your mind where parents have told something or a change in a particular thing which has resulted in a positive effect to children, so that they started listening or improved their behavior. Like the parents were living a different life, but then they bring a change in their own lives so that the children would see that and bring a change in own lives like leaving bad things, giving respect to parents and all. Does any such incident come in your mind? We have worked with lot of ladies and have noticed this in young children. See, what I am going to say is a very small thing, it is about discipline. When ladies come to our Rudra center, they use to chit chat and would talk anything. Children listens to those talks and they also started talking that way. They would talk anything like using abusive words, also when ladies are fooling around with each other mischievously , they would use hands for giving claps to each other or to pat at the back. All these things are going on. So over here children also use to come, as their mothers bring them. So because of that children were also getting influenced. So when we were doing the circle of sharing, this matter has been put forward that “See children are behaving this way, where do they learn it from? What you people are doing here for 3 to 4 hours by chit chatting together, this is what they see.” Then while working with mothers we taught them like this, so then they stopped using those kinds of words. Also we had made one rule for discipline, that nobody should use disrespectful language there. Because you may talk frankly when somebody is your friend.', 'Yes, you will be very frank with your friends. You may use such language, but the child who is seeing this doesn’t know that you can use frank language with friends. So for example if I am calling you in front of the child and say like “You do this”, then the child also will say the same thing that “You do this”. So then we had started doing this way that we started calling each other as Ben, and even if he is a very small child he should be called as brother. Then the child would also learn to respect. Once he grows up he will understand the difference that can I say “Tu” or “Tamey” to my friend or to whom should I say “Tu” or whom should I say “Tamey”. Thus the scenes of respecting others are put in them right from their childhood. So because of that, now the atmosphere has improved a lot.', 'So if parents change themselves, then there will be change in children as well. Yes, then they will change. The problem is in parenting. Parenting is a very big reason for the problem of differentiation between girls and boys. Society comes later. Parents tell in the house itself that boys can do this and girls can do that. So the brother will eat and keep the vessels and would tell the sister that “You wash”. Then girl will always have the question that why she has to wash? Then she will be made silenced by saying that “You have to wash it and this is your job and not your brother’s job. It’s your work my child”. They teach them like this adoringly.', 'Ok. They teach them adoringly. It starts from there. Therefore it is very important to start the work from parenting itself. Yes, there are a lot of projects in progress in that as well. Like how there are classes for girls about adolescence, we are going to start like that for boys as well.', 'Okay. You are going to do for boys also. Yes. Because nobody does for boys. Everybody is busy in teaching girls and it is important to take care for boys also. Right?', 'Yes, if it has been started from there, then there would be no problems. I have the feeling that in future, a time will come like how right now it is to save a girl child, like that in future it would be to save a boy child.', 'Yes, it would happen. Because it is very important to balance the way of how we are thinking.', 'If we see their family then is there any important person in their life who is outside the family? Do they have anyone like that? Definitely it has to be there. Here there are varieties of aspects in a society. At first it is their own family, then the neighbors, then friends, then comes community. Then they believe many people from their community itself as their intimate ones.', 'Okay. So they will have their well-wishers. There would be and they believe them as their well-wishers. The person may or may not be a well-wisher, but they believe that the person will do good for them, and so they believe that person.', 'That means with neighbor or else many ladies might be coming to you as well for speaking and opening their heart. So they keep each other’s respect like this. Yes.', 'Do they have somebody like this that, for example, if I have a friend and if he comes to me for something, I can never say no to him. Whatever kind of thing it is, it may be bad or illegal and I know that. But I would always stand with him. Is there any such person in their lives to whom they can’t say no to? Or any such person who will never say no to them? Such people are there. It is not only the case of slums. This circle is going on in the whole world. People use to stand with each other to maintain friendship or a relationship, right?', 'Yes. This is a very big question. So in this .....', 'Not like that. If they have such a person in each other’s lives, then who is that person. I want to know about the relation .For example at your place…. It is different for everybody. For each lady, it is different. For some lady it will be her sister, for example in my case my mother-in-law has taken such a place. I can tell her anything and even she can tell anything to me. Many people do not get along with mother-in-laws or elder co sisters. But I got along. For some people, they may get along with their neighbor or may be mothers. For me I have a very strong bond with my mother. My life is completely different from this community life and that is with the support of my mother. So everyone has in their own ways. Suppose there are brothers, then many of them listen to their uncles or many of them might share with their grandfathers or brothers of their father. This is different for each persons.', 'But it is always there. Yes. It is always there. Many people are so friendly with their elder brother-in-laws and so that they tell him everything.', 'Just now you spoke about mother-in-law and here everyone stays with mother-in-law. Then do they get along? I am asking about majority. Exception will always be there. Here everybody’s mentality is such that when we stay together, like when 4 vessels stay together, they will make sound. So sounds happen but they get along and when there is a bad situation or any sad situation, that time they stand by each other strongly. Like you said there are exceptional cases where mother-in-law will not help. That is a different thing. But in most situations, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law use to help each other.', 'So do you remember any such exceptional cases where currently there is a problem in their bond? Yes, there causes problem because many times comparison is done that this is mother-in-law and that is daughter-in-law, it comes from both sides. Many times daughter-in-law would not understand the situation of mother-in-law and also mother-in-law would not understand the situation of daughter-in-law. We have a lady over here and her delivery was on due. When the baby came, the mother-in-law went to stay with her elder daughter-in-law. When the lady got into a condition to be able to work, mother-in-law stayed with her. She is a rag picker. This lady has one elder son who is 5 or 6 years old. Recently she gave birth to another boy. That boy was born at the time of Diwali. So he is 4 to 6 months old. So the lady actually is in need of her mother-in-law. But she shifted to other place.', 'So the narrow mindedness also exists? Yes. But there is more of broad minded people over here. Here the relationship of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is very different. Here there many who would take more care than how mother would take care. What I just told you is an exceptional incident. Excluding that if you see the world over here, in general there is a mother daughter kind of relationship over here.', 'Then there must be some reason behind that? So if we leave slums and see the outside world, then it is not like that. Mostly all the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law don’t get along. Everyone is not same .', 'As you are saying, here it is completely opposite. Yes. It is opposite.', 'Is there any reason behind it? Because they believe in taking care of generations. I will tell you the reason from my point of view. I don’t know scientifically or by any other view point. What I feel is that though they are fighting, they empathize for each other. They feel that she has this problem or she might be going through this  and also they believe in taking care of generation as it is important to take care of our generation than other things.', 'Do they face any financial problems? They face a lot of financial problems.', 'Do they face any situation where they have to cut off their meal for one time in a day? Now the situation has improved a lot because employment has increased and somehow they use to get work. There are many families who have shifted from their state and are staying over here. In the initial stage they had problem of getting meals. But those who are staying here for years manage their food somehow, like the ladies who come to Rudra, they don’t do just Rudra work. For example they would be running a stitching machine at home or they would do work for 5 or 10 rupees for somebody. So their expense will be managed by that. Like that now the intensity of starving has reduced. Otherwise there were so many families who used to have food in the morning and don’t know what they would have in the evening.', 'So it is not decided? No. It is not decided. We also have gone through that kind of condition. For so many days we had not seen milk and we managed the whole day drinking Ukhada and we drank tea so that we don’t feel hungry. So like that we just had tea and have not eaten anything. We have managed many days like that. Now the situation is very different.', 'That means at the time when you were staying here, right? Yes, the time when I was 12 years old. When I was a teenager. The reason behind leaving my studies was financial problem. Because if there is a problem of food, how can you manage studying?', 'Yes. That is true, how can you study. That was the time when we also had gone through such a crisis. Right now also it is not very good, but we have that much ability that we manage our 2 times meal. We earn that much. If not from here, then from somewhere else.', 'That means meal is cooked for 3 times. Meal is not cooked 3 times over here. Meal is cooked only twice.', 'When? What are the timings? One in afternoon lunch. Here for breakfast everyone use to have roti and tea. The rotis are made and eaten during lunch as well. There would be one Sabji. In the night it will be same, may be at sometimes some people may make an additional kichdi.', 'Here people don’t think about nutritious wholesome meal or they just eat whatever they get? May be they don’t have any idea about this wholesome nutritious food. The moment the word nutritious comes, they think that they have to spend. They feel that it is expensive food and from that they get nutrition. But they still need awareness in the area that having seasonal food or cooking in a particular way and eating.', 'Is it so? Even people like us have just started reading, and so we have an idea that nutritious food is not expensive.', 'No. It is not expensive. Right ? We can make by taking seasonal food and eat it by cooking in a different way.', 'Still they don’t have that understanding? That understanding is less. The older generation is there know, who is very much older. Right now my grand mother-in-law is there to stay with me. She is around 85 to 90 years old and  still she is very fit that she gets up early in the morning, takes bath, follows her rituals, does prayer, does maala and then she will have breakfast. I asked her how is she so fit. She told me her food habits and all, that she use to eat this food, use to do these things, use to stay like that and use to have rule that they shouldn’t eat after a certain time. So they used to follow the diet. In those times the diet was called as rules which they had to follow.', 'So those have not passed on? May be those haven’t passed on because in this generation there are some good things, but one of the biggest negative thing that have entered is we have stopped listening to our older generations. A lot of the things that these elder people say are useless, but the talks that is related to the food and values are important. But we think they are just blabbering. The situation has become such that the people are now asking them back that “How do you know the requirements of the present time?”. This is what happened. But if we are understanding the way of the food and the way of living they had or if we are listening to them we can understand how even at this age they are walking. We have started having problems of knee pain at such a young age. Why they don’t have? The reason could be that they were having pure food. Apart from that they have lived their life very carefully like in the way of eating food and all.', 'That means the people are not trying to understand them because along with things which we need to learn from them there are many unwanted things as well. And may be the method is also different. Todays generation starts understanding things at a very early age. So they feel that “We are very clever and we understand more than them”. They are told like “Now you have become old. You are from old times and why are you sitting and telling us stories of your old time?” .In our generation the patience is reduced. Capacity to bear is reduced and we don’t think like “She is my grandmother and she might be telling 10 things, out of which 2 may be useful and we need to take them”. We don’t take those 2 things, instead we react thinking about those unwanted 8 things.', 'Okay. Here in whatever people are eating, do they have importance for tasty food or do they manage with whatever they get? Or do they need extra spice and salt or don’t they enjoy food if it is not tasty? Is there any such things? People of all types lives here. Those who need tasty food and also those who eat whatever they get. Majority of those who have importance for the taste use that red chilli powder and more of oil. If you see their sabji, the oil will be floating on the top and the chilli has to be so strong that if their tongue doesn’t get burned, they feel that the food is bland. They say that vegetable is like cow dung. So they will never accept salads. They cant imagine food with less spice and chilli.', 'Generally what kind of body people have over here? Are they fat, thin or have body of proper measurement? I think most of them have body of proper measurement.', 'That means? That means neither fat nor thin, but of proper measurement.', 'Okay. Yes, because they do a lot of work. In the full day they have to walk.', 'Don’t they need to do exercise? In a way they don’t need to do exercise, but in other way they should do exercise because it is always to do exercise with the awareness. Here they don’t have the idea that my body is getting exercised automatically or by doing this is better for certain part of the body. But they never do Yoga or Pranayam, with the awareness. There is a higher rate of breathing problem over here and they don’t have the understanding about breathing. So there is a need to make them do such things.', 'So if we make them do, then will they do? You might have started these Yoga lectures? But we have to really work hard for that. Because they have these understanding that doing these exercises are helpful for the body. But they say like “We do these whole day and we go to sleep immediately as we go to bed because in full day we are doing so much of work and our body is paining. We are getting that much tired. Then why are we doing exercises”. They know it like that only. They have only a little understanding about doing things properly, following rules and therefore their mind is not allowing them for accepting that. So this area needs to be worked on.', 'So their mentality stops them. More than their mentality, it is their lifestyle that stops them.', 'Right. They have this feeling that they are doing so much of work and so we are tired and it is more than enough.', 'Is there anything that we can do, by which they might start exercising? Even if they do 30 minutes a day, but something like Yoga or some basics by which they will get lot of benefits and not like what they do normally like by picking rags or like that. Here the mentality is this because everybody is living their life with full of struggles and they have to think a lot about time like “When I am spending 15 to 20 minutes for something, then what I am getting in return for that”. We are failing. I cannot say as failing, but we are trying. We have not still got proper……', 'You have not still got response? Yes, we have not got proper response. And this is one of the reasons. Like in the class that we conduct for girls, the same question arises in front of us like ”If our girls are coming for one hour for the classes, then what will they get”. They need something physical that they can hold in their hands which they can use in their lives. Then they will feel that “Okay, it is right to do this”.', 'Okay. Because they have struggle every day. They have to work hard for everything. So they will feel like “Rather than giving one hour over here, if I am going out and work there for one hour, then I will get money. Then I can eat food with that money. My children can study with that money. I can buy clothes with that money. I can manage my social commitments with that money”. So they have this kind of mentality at all levels, it can be more or less. So still explaining this is in process.', 'Do you have any exceptional case in this, that there is nobody in this matter? They are there, that Rudra sisters are there. The ladies who are in Rudra centers are doing exercises. We have introduced Surya Namaskar to them and they are doing.', 'Okay, are they doing? How about males? Do they do? It is very difficult with males, because they too much of ego. We are trying to work on it. But they have this feeling that they are doing the most work that is there in the world. Whereas wives are doing full day, as they go out and do labor work and come. Still they have this kind of expectation from them that “When I come home, you have to serve food to me. You should be available at home. You finish the entire household work and then sleep ”. It is like that. When they finish their work and come home, they would not do anything. A glass of water also need to be given into their hands. There are only a very few husbands who help their wives or support them in everything. Even if they cannot help in their work, at least they will give mental support like “Okay, I am there with you”. There are very few like that.', 'What kind of work do they do? Are you asking about husbands? In them everyone do different occupations. Some do labor, they drive pedal rickshaw or do government jobs.', 'Government job means? There are officers in government jobs. Some work in banks. Some work in Torrent company, which is the electricity company.', 'Work means what type of work do they do? For them, I don’t have any idea about their internal work. And so I cannot tell you the posts.', 'If they are in good posts, then what is the need for them to stay over here? I told you know there are many who earn 30 to 40 thousand per month. They are staying here for generations.', 'So they are comfortable here. They have attachment to this place. And everybody thinks like that “Why should we leave this place, because crows are black everywhere” . If you go in any of the societies and climb the staircases, you will see the stains of spit after having betel leaves. Ground will always be dirty. Who will clean? Why should one clean? Who will take responsibility? More than that I feel unity in the Chaul system. People of Chaul, keep their Chaul clean. People in the society don’t keep it clean. Society people say like “It is your responsibility. We are paying maintenance fee to you” and like that they take their hands off from the matter. So those who are educated and doing good job and earning well, they think about those things and will not clean. Then why should we go to such a place where nobody believes in these things and where is no importance of relationship. So if you are going to stay in a flat, how many relations would you have? If somebody is dying in the neighborhood, then you will come to know only after one week. People only check when they feel like that the person in the next flat has not been seen for one week. Whereas in the Chaul system, ten houses will know even if you sneezed. And if somebody is becoming sick, then people stay there till midnight. So here people give more importance to relations than any other thing.', 'So those who are educated must be very few know? There are many. When you go to each and every area, you will find variety of people. There are area where people make houses of jute and stay. There are areas where people do own business, it may be small or big. There are some areas where people do good jobs.', 'Then do they also have ego, like how you spoke about before? What kind of ego?', 'Like as you said they will not take their own glass of water. Yes, \\xa0that is in-built in everybody.', 'Isn’t it that it has changed by education? Do you think that our education system is that strong that it will teach that? You answer that to me.', \"Yes, in education system…. What do they teach in the education system you have seen so far? First thing they get into is about jobs and how much you will earn. But ”how much you help your family?”, \\xa0that does not come. So  at first that need to be taught. When you get into a position,  the first thing that is been taught is that, since you are on that particular post you can't do this particular thing. If there is a big officer, \\xa0then you would see very rarely like they giving water to somebody. Then what is the use of such education?\", 'Here normally most people do labor work only, right? Majority of people.', 'Do majority of males go for work? Yes.', \"As I were roaming here, I heard like more than half are not doing work. They drink and keep laying and if they get up to their senses, then they go for work for getting money to buy alcohol for that night. That is there in some special community people. \\xa0I don't want to take the name of that community. In that community, gents use to dominate in the house. But they drink alcohol and keep laying. Wives go for earning and manage the house. There is a community like that.\", 'Okay. Then how much percentage do that community occupies? This is about the community that is there in the whole state. Here also they are there at some places.', 'So approximately here how many percentage of such people must be there? Around 20 percent must be there.', '20 percent. When you walk and come from Gandhi Ashram, \\xa0there at the bridge of Chandrabhaga lot of people stay.', 'This is the place where we get down from Silver Cloud? They are all weavers know. No, \\xa0weavers do weaving work. And they are all from different communities, but stay together. If you see, \\xa0then the most progressive community is the weavers community. Because there is very less addiction in their community and there is more of education. They try to understand the lifestyle in a much better way. We have done a survey and have seen that the people of that community is very progressive.', 'Which is the most backward community? It is very difficult to tell about the most backward community.', \"Okay, You can take three or four names, no problem. I don't feel like taking names.\", 'No, \\xa0that will help me to understand about where I need to give more focus and where I need to put less stress. And the work will be done according to that. For that you can take a walk in the community and meet 4 to 5 people. Then you will get an idea. If you feel like that these people look like backward, then talk to them. Like how you are talking to me and I am giving you information, like that they will also give you information. Because you have the skill of doing the work by asking questions.', 'No, the main reason for why I am talking to you is that instead of roaming everywhere, you can give me the essence with your experience of 15 to 20 years. I am giving you the essence. But I want you to do little work also.', 'Yes, \\xa0I will work hard. Work for that, \\xa0because I am giving you information from my perception according to what I believe. But if you are meeting 4 to 5 people on your way, then it will be much better, because it is about the whole community. It is about labelling them.', 'Okay , And approximately what must be the population? Around 50000 to one lakh must be there.', 'That much of population must be there. It must be there, \\xa0because Tekro is very big, right from Vadaj bus stand to ONGC petrol pump. \\xa0Towards this side, ONGC gas is there know.', 'Is it below? No not below. \\xa0When you are going towards Ranip, till there Tekro is spread. It is that much broad and that much long.', 'Do tracks pass in between? Tracks?', 'When we go from Ranip, then jewelry market comes and then the tracks pass. So do those tracks pass on the top of the hill? I meant railway tracks. No, no there.', 'Then on the opposite side. Yes, \\xa0that is on opposite side.', 'If somebody is sick in the house, \\xa0then what are the things that they do? Do they cook separately for them or do such separate care is taken for them? Is there any such thing? If diseases are such, then only the question of cooking separate arises. For example, if the person has TB and the family members know about that, then they would cook separately for them and give. Also I have seen that \\xa0these people have never turned their back when there comes a question of taking care. It may be with their heart, with the fear of their community or by thinking it as their own duty. But they do take care.', 'So they make separate meals. If the patient is a TB patient, \\xa0then the cooking is done separately. For them doctors advises that we should emphasize on cooking separate for that person and need to keep their vessels as separate, since it is a contagious disease . Otherwise it is not like that “The person is sick, so cook separate for him”. It is cooked only if it is required.', \"If it is a major disease, then only. That also if the doctor has suggested, then only. Otherwise they don't cook separate for the reason of not able to touch them.\", 'Now you told that these people earn on daily basis and manage their house on daily basis. In such a situation if somebody is falling sick, then what do they do? They take loan.', 'They take loan. Here there is higher rates of taking loans.', \"But everyone will be like that only, then from whom do they take loan ? Here they have their internal dealings going on. This is also one of the reason for why the change is not coming. Who will help you at the time of need? \\xa0Who will give loan to an outside poor person? So what they would do is,  internally they have their leader in their community, those who have big names and  who are important people. They take loan from such people. Since they have taken loan, \\xa0they come under other’s obligation. So whatever tradition those people would tell,  these people need to follow them. So there are some people who somehow,  I don't know how, earn a lot of money. There are people who do so much of hard work and is not able see money. Whereas these people earn by just sitting itself. Only god knows how these people are earning. But they take loan from these people.\", 'Is it possible that those people might be cheating them? Many people cheat them. They give loan at the rate of 10 percent. What is that?', 'They give loan at 10 percent. Is it like small amounts. Yes, 5 percent. Yes, it is a small amount.', \"That means they don't want to get back their principal amount. It’s okay if I am getting my principal amount even after 10 years. I am getting my money .\", 'Yes, they get their interest. It is like that. They \\xa0have their Mandal. They have their own internal saving accounts for 2 or 5 years. So they manage themselves from that.', 'But those must be very few know? What?', 'Mandals. There are many Mandals, in small or big sizes. Lot of Mandals are going on.', 'How do those people who are going for labor or riding pedal rickshaw, find their work? They get it through each other.', 'Through each other. Yes, I told you know there is very strong social bonding over here. So even if a new person is coming here to stay, \\xa0he will become familiar there in 1 month.', 'He will become familiar ? Yes, \\xa0everybody would take care of that person saying that “See here, this place is here. You go there” or ”Meet these people”. So they connect socially and they get small or big work. They also have this desperation that I have to eat by earning myself. So this is very strong and positive thing that they have. So they finds their own means for earning themselves.', 'What is meant by desperation? Desperation means strong internal feeling that I want to do this. You can call it as curiosity.', 'There are many placement Institutions for jobs or NGOs like Manav Sadhna. They help them to get job at many places. Do they take help of those institutions? See I told you know, at first they go socially. Then go to an institution at a later stage, because they have more trust socially, like their own relative or their own neighbor. Even if it is a relative of relative of relative, like at a 3rd or 4th distance, they have more trust there. They have the trust like that person will always think good for me, as we know them. So they would go in that circle. Even if they go to the agency, they have the fear that they would be cheated. Because they had lived their life so much of being exploited. So it is very difficult for them to trust somebody else. And the other thing there is self-respect. Today if a poor person goes and stands in an office, who would pay attention to him? Nobody would pay attention. They will be just sitting there. Even if they are sitting, they will be told to get up by saying that “See, this gentleman has come. So you get up and allow them to sit.” This kind of thing is there. So they have this fear. I have seen this. They have their own self-respect. They love that. They will be sitting by starving, but if they feel that “Here I haven’t been given respect”, then they will not go there.', \"Do they trust NGOs? They have slowly started trusting those NGOs who are working for so many years in that particular area , like Gramshree, ESI and Manav Sadhna which are working there for 20 to 22 years. But still you can't say that it is a blind trust. They think 10 times before doing anything.\", 'Is there anybody else working there, apart from Manav Sadhna. There is one Institute called Seva, which is working there. Then there is one Jeevan Theerth institution, which is also working there.', \"But all those are still little behind. Do they have trust on them also? No, they have started just recently. Seva Sanstha is very old. And I don't want to discuss that aspects. I don't want it to be recorded. But all the other institutions are new. Manav Sadhna is working since 22 years and it is a constant work that they have done. These institutions like Manav Sadhna, ESI or Gramshree are not just about talking or only on paper. It is there on paper and in talks, but there is a practical aspect of that also. There is a practical hand that we are using and it is not like we just talk and forgotten it. If you see over here, there would be generations who had sacrificed for this. There have been for generations. \\xa0Gandhiji , then after that his followers took it up, Eashwar Dhadha and after him Jayesh Bhai and after that there are people like us.\", 'So that is the reason for the trust, as it is very old. They are working from generation to generation.', 'Yes, the work can be seen and in anywhere else the work is not seen. We are working, but it is not like we want grants or donations and so we write good proposals on paper, make websites or take interviews and publishes and ask them to give the money. It is not like that. Here we work first and people can see that work. If people feel like to give us money, then they can give. Or if they want to give grant or donation, then they give. Otherwise people are busy over here in helping, by putting their best foot forward. No one has even the slightest thought for cheating somebody.', 'Yes, that is true. Nobody has such thought. There may be differences in opinions between trustees and workers. And as they are human beings, it is not necessary that they get along with everybody. But when it comes to work that we want to work for the betterment of the society, then everyone is like a pearl in the same string.', 'So they trust these people because of their way of thinking. They have seen the work.', \"Yes, they have seen the work. There they haven't seen like speaking good talks and running away when the actual work comes. We have walked in muds and done the work. We have cleaned gutters. We have cleaned toilets. We have given birth to unkempt and dirty children. We have cleaned their private parts, cleaned their noses without any aversion. Not like doing work with a spoilt face. Two to three generations have worked with medications and have given all the sacrifices. They have seen 3 to 4 generations who had given everything in this and the new children are also joining in this. So even this generation is there. That is how the trust is built.\", 'Do they have bank account over here in our house? Yes, nowadays they have. Almost everybody has a bank account.', 'Is there any common bank or everybody has in different banks? SBI and Dhana bank. These two banks are very common.', \"How about insurance? Do they have? They don't declare that we have insurances. But they have.\", 'How about life insurance? Yes, \\xa0even they have for their kids. \\xa0Also they have for themselves . If you ask in Rudra Center, then ladies have.', \"Then what is the reason for not declaring? I don't know about that. We have not worked on that to know why they are not declaring.\", 'I am just asking about any general perception, like if you have any idea about that. I cannot say even general perception, because honestly I have never paid attention on that.', 'The are many government schemes for skill development like Kaushalya Talim Yojana and like that. Do these people take advantage of those? Yes, they take advantage.', 'Are they are very less? Yes, but they take advantage. Before it was like that when government declares some scheme, then it does not come to the lower level of the society. It was like that before around 15 years back, right? \\xa0And everything was swept under the carpet. But now for the last 10 to 12 years the things are going very well, that if there is coming any government scheme, then people in the lowest level of society would come to know about it. So 100 percent effort is made for encouraging the people to take the training. \\xa0And lot of people are taking training.', 'How about the quantity of sugar that is used in the food that they eat or in the cooking that they do every day? The quantity of sugar is more. It is mostly in tea. The rate of drinking tea is very high in the area, where I am staying and working currently.', 'Where you are staying? Is it close to Rudra? Yes, I was staying in Ramapir Tekra only.', 'But the Tekra is very big. I can tell only considering the whole Tekra, because we roam around the whole Tekra. As they drink lot of tea, lot of sugar is used in that. They easily drink 5 to 6 cups of tea in a day.', '5 to 6 cups. And there are many people in the house. So \\xa0you can think and calculate. Suppose there are seven people in a house, \\xa0then in a month 5 to 7 kilo of sugar is used.', 'So is it only in tea and there is nothing else like sweets? In something else, \\xa0when the guests have come then they make Shira from the semolina. Sugar is used in that. They won’t use sugar in rest of the things like Sabji and all. They eat it as very spicy.', 'They eat spicy. Do they ever tried to experiment by making the tea without sugar and drink it? No, they don’t drink tea with sugar, except if somebody has diabetes.', \"Do they have the knowledge that too much of sugar is harmful for the body or like it is beneficiary to us if we are leaving sugar ? See they know everything. But what they say “Live your life”, this is the common answer that everybody gives. We also have worked on the cases of addictions for people drinking alcohol, for people eating Gutkha and for people getting TB. For providing awareness about that, we have done work. We have done drama in Chauls, but they have only one answer that “Anyhow we are going to die, then why like to do something or not to do something. Why to live like that? In hospitals we have seen many people like even when they don't have any addictions, they have got mouth cancer.” So they tell like “You don’t try to explain to us. Let us do what we are doing”. There is lot of people who have this kind of mindset.\", 'They are stubborn. Yes, \\xa0stubborn mindset.', \"So they know about the importance, but they don't want to follow. More than don’t want to follow, they have the trouble of the entire world. There are many wise people who have lot of knowledge and understanding. But it remains limited till understanding. It does not go ahead of that. When it comes to applying, we fall weak.\", 'Suppose if somebody has fall sick, then do they go immediately to the doctor? If the small age kids are sick, then they would go immediately. Whereas ladies and gents will bear it, till they can bear. When they feel like that they cannot bear beyond this level, then they would go to the doctor. If somebody from the Chaul or from neighborhood is pressurizing them to go telling like “Now you must go to the doctor. Go, You must go ”, then they would go. When they do like “You have got fever, go, go”, then only they will go. Otherwise they will not consult the doctor immediately. They would feel that the doctors are doing business, \\xa0because even if there is nothing they would ask to do 2 to 3 reports. From where do they get that much money ? That is true. Even if they are getting cough, doctor would give big prescriptions of medicines. And because of such experience with the doctors, they have the feeling that they don’t need to go to the doctor immediately and initially they might do whatever home remedies they know. Like if somebody gets fever, then stripes of cold water should be put on their body, massage ball of bell metal on legs , massage onion or put it under arms, sleep after applying balm or drink neem water. At first these things need to be done. Even after doing all these things, still they are not cured, then they would go to the doctor.', 'If their children are small, then would they take care? They take more care for small children, so they go.', 'When they go to doctor, he may suggest that you have to take this care, you have to eat this less or stop eating this. Then do they follow such suggestions or no. Mostly they don’t follow.', 'Then what is the reason for that? The reason I told you know.', 'Yes, everybody has to die one day, so…. Yeah, like doctors will keep telling. It is like that.', 'Do they say like that? Yes. They have lot of respect for doctors that doctors are as good as god. But they have this habit know, so it is very difficult for them to leave.', 'Yes, so they try to escape by giving reasons. Then many a times this can also happen know. Like if I am falling sick and is going to see the doctor, he might give me medicines for 15 days. But I may become alright in 4 to 5 days. Then medicine will be on side and I will be on the other side. Yes, they will not complete the course.', 'So do they do like that? \\xa0Do they leave the course in between? Then how about children? For children, they will complete. They are not that much careless about their children.', 'So they are careless about themselves. They are a bit careless about themselves.', \"So is that the financial reason by which they are not completing the course? Is that because of money? Money is definitely one of the reasons for that. They will have the feeling that I have took medicine for 4 days and now I am feeling better, so I don't need to continue the medicine. So that money is saved.\", \"Is there any other reason? No, this is the main reason. And nowadays they have developed distrust on the doctors, because the way the normal people are squeezed by the doctors are going towards dangerous level. You can write it down, that people will stop trusting doctors. See what I am going to say now is a bit negative. People are losing their trust on them because of the way the treatments are done. They say like “Doctors will keep telling, because they want to earn money. Even for small things they would ask for this report and that report. Don't they understand as they have studied so much”. This type of mentality is there. In old times doctors has never did so many reports.\", \"Yes, they have worked on experience. Yes, because 2 to 3 generations used to stay together. You won't believe that before for doing the vaccination for kids of five years, they use to come to verge of crying. Why don’t these people understand that it is important to do vaccination, it is important to do polio dosages, because the older generation would say “Don’t you see your father. We have not given vaccination to him. Still he is alive and walking know. Nothing has happened to him and you keep pushing injections into the body. You are making holes in the body”. They say like that.\", \"Do they say like that? Yes, they say like “I don’t want to put holes in my children's body”. They say like “You all are puncturing the body”\", 'That means there is an anger in them. How much willpower do they have? Suppose if somebody is having cholesterol and if the doctor is asking them to reduce salt, to stop having salt or to reduce sugar, then will they be able to decide to leave that? They would do in these type of cases which you are narrating. Suppose if you are having fever and you use to eat Gutkha. Suppose doctor has given you medicines for fever or for any other reason and tells you that “This is happening because of Gutkha and so you need to stop Gutkha”. Then they will not leave it. They don’t have that willpower.', 'So they cannot leave addictions, \\xa0but can leave the food items like sugar, salt or oil. Yes. I have a friend who is in the Institute itself. His father has been hospitalized. He has an ulcer in his lungs. It is a very big ulcer. He has the habit of having slaked lime. So doctor has told him that “You should not have the slaked lime”. Medicine is on and the slaked lime is also on.', 'Okay, that means there is less possibility of giving up addictions. Yeah, that is less.', 'But if they have been told to take care of these things, then they would take care. Yes. Because in the case of diabetes, they know that this is the sickness and what happens if we are not leaving sugar. They have seen it and it is something that they have experienced. The other case becomes like an advice for which they haven’t experienced. For this they know as they have seen the patients of diabetes, also they themselves has experienced about what happens. And each and every person eating Gutkha doesn’t get cancer, right? So they have seen these things in their generations. Their old generation people used to eat too much of tobacco. They used to smoke tobacco. So they have grown up by seeing this old generation. Then why will they listen to the doctors. They say “Go away, Look at these children who are alive.”', 'During your visits you might be meeting such ladies or people who has to stop having certain things. So do they talk to you about such things like “Doctor has told, but I am feeling it like too bland and finding it tasty. I am unbale to adjust.”? Yes, they tell. It is very common.', 'So they are feeling it as a bad experience. Yes.', 'Does it happen like they would eat it by hiding without anyone’s knowledge or cheat and eat? Is it like that? No, it is not like that. Who is going to stop anyone. Everybody is the king of their mind. In fact the people here believe like “Who can stop me?”. I were telling you know that the trust towards the doctors are reducing. We don’t know what will happen after sometime, because this kind of things are going on. These things are actually going on.', 'Yes, it has become a business. And because of that the reputation of many good doctors are also getting spoilt.', 'Yes, that is true. Because if we are considering the cases of deliveries, out of 10 deliveries they do cesarean for 8 of them. 8 people!', 'Yes. What kind of lifestyle is that? Forget about the previous generation. Even in this generation, they are taking care right from the beginning.', 'Yeah, lot of care is taken. As soon as you are getting conceived, you are taking advice from the doctor, medicine is started and all the medicines are taken regularly and reports are taken. Sonography and whatever is need to be done, all are done on a regular basis. Everybody knows that as everyone, including husband and mother-in-law, is given instructions like to give her certain kind of food or not to give certain kind of food, to live in a particular way or not to live in a particular way, right? If not 100 percent, but at least they might be following it at least 80 percent know. Even then why are they not able to have a normal delivery on the last day.', 'Yeah, they don’t have normal delivery. So then doesn’t this question arise?', 'Yes, they have commercialized it. You think about it. There was this old generation, see I am not doing comparison between the old and new generation. But this is about the experience and as a human being I feel like questioning like “What is right?”. There was a generation who lived their life with their own rules. Is that true? Or there is the things which this education is explaining to us, is that true? Because if you the previous old generation they used to deliver about 5 children as normal delivery.', 'Yes, everyone. This is true. Still they don’t die. They live healthy life. They live 70 to 80 years and then only they expire.', 'Yes, they use to live very long life. Whereas during this time so much of care has been taken and medicines are given right from the beginning. Still the children are born with diseases and they need to be kept in incubator. They have heart problems. So this need to researched to know what is the problem for “In spite of taking so much of care, at last this is the result” . That is why the trust on the doctors have been reduced. And you have to do cesarean means you have to put 15 to 20 thousand rupees on the table at first.', 'Yes, they first ask for money. There is the problem. Then see how they make you scared by saying “If you do this, then one of them only will survive” or “If you don’t do this, then this thing will happen ”. Then those poor people will follow that.', 'Yeah they have to do. You have done so many camps or so many projects are running. Have you found any resistance or any opposition like “Leave this, we don’t want to do this”? Have you seen something like that? We didn’t find any such thing in camps, because people need such things because they want to know such things that “What is going on?”. So there is no resistance in that.', 'Suppose if we are telling them to take physical exercise by saying that “It is okay that you are having your physical exercise while doing your work, but you must do yoga”. Like that if it is yoga that they need to do, then what is it that is stopping them? See, when we are considering a camp, for how many days the camp will be there? So they respond to camps.', 'Yes. When it comes to applying in their daily life, they fall weak. Because their life is full of running around and have ten types of tensions like husband is there, children are there, we have to earn, we have to take care of house or we have to clean the house. They have all these things, so how to obtain time from this. Also they want to have their entertainment. See where we grew up, what is the thing for the entertainment in their lives ? It is TV, right. Except that what is there for the entertainment ? May be sometimes, once in a year if we can afford and if we have money in our pocket, then we go to our own village and roam about. We have never been to our village. So one of the way to entertain is that to go to the village and roam about. There is no other kinds of entertainment in our lives. And we celebrate festivals. Otherwise the things like going for movies, picnic or a long trip are never there. They find it very easy to get entertainment from the TV by listening to songs, watching movies or just watching TV. So they find it right to put their time in that. Because they are working for the whole day and they feels like that they need to sit together at least for sometimes. So they feel that also as an extra work for them.', 'So as per your experience, is there anything new that you did to encourage them for which they responded back? We are trying many different ways. I am still not able to tell you an example that has gone successful.', 'At least successful to some extent. That I told you know about the Rudra Center ladies, we have taught them Surya Namaskar. They don’t do it completely, but they are doing Pranayams. We taught them deep breathing, so they would not be doing Pranayam, but they are doing deep breathing. They feel that as nice.', 'Is it so? We did prayers with them. We tell them to do prayers at 1’o clock. Nobody was ready when we told them initially. Everybody used to feel like “Instead of giving half an hour in this, we can do some work for half an hour and can earn. Even if we are doing one line of embroidery and is getting only 4 rupees, it is okay for one hour”, and nobody used to sit. It took about 8 months for us to even put into their mind that “This is very important for you to improve your mental status as you are sitting quietly”. We are doing prayers, but it is just a medium. At least they would be able to sit relaxed, otherwise they are always doing this or that or chit chatting, right? They don’t sit quietly at all. So we have found this way that by using prayers as medium, at least they will sit quietly for some time, listen to good words, read and they can talk whatever is there in the mind.', 'Did you do something different to make them understand, because 8 months is a pretty long time? We have used many different techniques.', 'Can you tell one or two? For make them pray what we done is that we made chits and then everyday if they are coming there will be prayer for two minutes, then reading has to be done mandatorily after that and then would speak good things. In the chits there will be name of the songs like in one chit there will be devotional songs, in other there will be any other songs, in other a story will be written and in other there will be a game. So like that there were chits of 4 category and it starts like as I start to bang on the door, they need to pass. And as soon as I stop banging, a lady need to pick one chit from it. So near to which lady I am standing, she need to pick the chit and make them do that activity. Every day it will be in different ways. By putting four different chits, it will be different for 4 days . One day it will be for music or one day it will be games. So they use to like it, as there are different activities in different days.', 'Yes. So you transformed them with games. Yes, we transformed them. That was one thing that we did, but now there is no need to do that. Now whether I am there or not, the prayers will be done at 1’o clock.', 'Yes, yesterday I saw the satisfaction. Yesterday we went to Rudra, there was an elderly lady and 4 to 5 other ladies. So there was a lot of talk about prayers like how is it started and now they are enjoying doing prayers. They told me a little about that and I felt them as quite satisfied. Yes, because when they are talking, we can feel that. Before that they have never trusted, even to each other. So in circle of sharing itself, it use to be very difficult. They use to be scared many a times and that fear was for true reason. Because I speak my heart over here, but if these people speak their heart to outside or to somebody in their family then they would fall in trouble.', 'Yeah, that becomes a problem. Yes, so they use to scared for opening up. But now in Rudra Center, this is a daily activity. It is a daily practice. We are holding practices very strongly, because that is the ultimate truth and rest all is rubbish. Rest all should be thrown to the river, unless you can implement it. We believe in that, so we do it every day. Even if there is only two ladies, then two of them will do. And if there is nobody and I am alone, then I also will be praying at that time. We have kept that staunchness to a certain extent.', 'Rules should be followed properly. Yes, because nothing is useful when it does not come into your practice. So now have the internal trust that their matters will not go outside. The circle which is sitting here will remain internal by itself. So now if they are having any problem, they speak their heart out and would cry also. So it took 8 months. You can think about it, like it took 8 month for us to just start doing prayers for five minutes. So they would be definitely satisfied, right. Because now their body is experiencing it that as they are sitting for five minutes or half an hour, it is giving peace for their body and mind which they don’t get at home. At home they are not able to sit peacefully at all.', 'By considering Surya Namaskar as an example, do you have to check afterwards that whether they are doing it or not, like what we call as follow up or monitoring? Suppose you had done a camp and had given some advice. For some people it would be important to persuade it and he may make it difficult for you. But then we would need to do the follow up. Then do you do that? And if you are doing, then how would you follow up? We have this circle of sharing, know. We can count that as one of the follow up medium as well. We don’t keep any professional way of following up like it has to be done in this particular way. We have it in the daily life by visiting personally to their houses, seeing and observing it. Also we ask about that in the circle of sharing that whether they are doing it or not. In that we come to know that what are the things which are done and what are the things that are not followed.', 'Is there any other way or any other medium? No other medium, because here we are working only on relational bonding. Because if these people are feeling like that they are studying us or using us for their advantage, many people would have distrust because of that also. They would think like these people are earning money by knowing our stories and at many a times that is true as well. Many institutions use to earn money in the name of poor people and those poor people don’t get anything.', 'It happened with us also. Yesterday when we went to Paryavaran Mitra, then Disha Ben was not there, only Mahesh Bhai was there. Initially he refused by saying “Please, don’t do shooting” because I were meeting him for the first time. Then one lady came with whom I had a conversation. She told me that you people would click our pictures and show in other countries to show that “See, we are poor” and would do mockery of us. So don’t use camera at all. But that is the truth. They are cheated. Poor people are cheated from all the sides.', 'That’s true. Everybody takes their own advantage in their name. if you see a corporate, then whom do they look at as consumers. They target the poor people at first. But what do they get in return. Those people, in the name of whom you are earning, are not getting anything out of it. Because they don’t ask for royalty like “You are using our name, you are using our community. So give us royalty”. Whereas royalty is there in all the businesses, but nowadays there is no loyalty.', 'Yes, there is confusion in both. Because if you are a writer, then for your write ups or for your books, how much you would keep getting for years. Whereas you earn so much in the name of these people and you don’t even appreciate or express your thankfulness to them. There is not even a slightest gratitude and they are earning by using these people’s names. So they have a lot of distress.', 'Do these people know about diabetes? Yes, they know about it now. As we are working on that for so many years, now they know about it.', 'Do most of the community know about it or very less people know about it ? Mostly everybody in the community know about diabetes.', 'Right. In our Rudra Center, there is a lady called Champa Ben. Her daughter who is about 5 to 6 year old is having diabetes. Such a small daughter.', 'Then to what extent do they know about it, like what causes diabetes, what are the cares that need to be taken, can it be cured or not, which parts of the body are harmed by it or which are other diseases caused by that ? So like that to what extent? They may not be knowing about the last two parts, that which parts of the body are harmed by it and which are other diseases caused by that. That they don’t know. They know what causes diabetes and what happens when a person gets diabetes. They know that and whether it can be cured or not. Their knowledge is till there. They don’t know about the last two questions that you said.', 'Okay, then as per your observation how much of the community is affected by diabetes? Do you see such people or are they very rare? See, the thing over here is like, from the moment they know that they are having diabetes, they start taking care. Here there is a belief, which is prevailing over here and is truth as well, that if you are having diabetes and you are getting hurt, then that part of body starts decaying. So they know all that. So if diabetes is diagnosed and like that they come to know that “I have this problem”, then they will take care. So for lot of people, we don’t come to know that this person has diabetes.', 'Okay. Other people will not come to know that this person is having diabetes. Today if we both are sitting, then you would not be able to know that the opposite person is having diabetes. Same is the case with TB. See these people are scared to some extent to share about diseases. They think that if they are sharing about their disease to someone else, then that person might keep aversion from them.', 'Okay. So they don’t tell openly.', 'Right. Many people have diabetes. If you see Ramapir Tekra, then lot of people of different ages would be having diabetes. It could be in first stage or in extreme level also, but it doesn’t get publicized.', 'It doesn’t come out. Then how do they socialize? In which matter?', 'When they chit chats, then so many topics come out. This kind of topic also comes out, know. Many household topics also comes. House hold matters are okay. But they have this feeling that why should we talk about sickness. They have the feeling that “If I am having some physical problem, then how can you help me? You are not going to cure me. Then what is the need for informing you?”. They have this mental level like if you are going to help in curing it by telling “If you do this you would get cured”, then they will tell you. If you are not going to help them with that sickness, then why they should discuss about it? Ladies may tell. Even if they are having a small problem, they will discuss about it immediately. That tendency is less in gents.', 'Yes, ladies talk internally, whereas it is less in gents. Gents have this feeling that if there is a problem, let’s take medicine and what is there to tell. It is this way.', 'Do they know the reasons due to which it happens? Mostly they know one reason only or two reasons, that if it is there in our previous generation, then it would come to us or if we eat too much sweets, then also it would come.', 'Right. So they know quite a lot. Do they use phone? Yes.', 'Almost everybody? Yes, nowadays almost everybody uses phones.', 'Approximately how many phones must be there in a house? Oh my god. Per house?', 'I am asking because there would be 7 people in a house, know. Yes, but there is an age difference in 7 of them. So it is very difficult for me to tell. But I can tell you that if there are youngsters in the house, then mostly that many phones will be there and now you can make an approximation about that.', 'Okay, that many. Then how about the generation which are parents? Parents will have, minimum 2 will be there. You can consider in that way.', 'Then what type of phones would be that? Is it android touch-screen phones or normal basic phones? They keep smart phones also. The generation of parents use the normal phones, but the people from our generation , that is the people of our age use smart phones.', 'What is the main usage of phone? Mainly they use internet, like seeing things on internet, listening to music, do searching. They also use it for clicking pictures, to talk on the phone.', 'WhatsApp, Facebook ? Yes, they use everything.', 'But that is about youngsters. The how about……. Those who are of higher age use it for making and receiving a call.', 'That’s it, only to talk? They use it only for communication.', 'And youngsters use everything. Yes, youngsters use everything.', 'Have you seen like anybody using it for any good purposes? For good cause, many a times it has happened like if they have seen somebody as sick, then immediately they will call to 108 using phone. I have seen many people using phone for this good cause.', 'There are so many application in phone. There are some application which helps to get a job and it becomes easy to get a job by using that. For example Naukri.com and like that there is lot of things. I don’t have much knowledge up to that level.', 'Whether somebody is using the phone to earn money, to get a job or to get salary, how about that? I have very less knowledge about it, I have no idea.', 'If we are making an application by which they can get job by sitting at home and don’t need to go out in search for the job, like you are at home and you may receive an SMS from our side by saying “You come at a certain place at a certain time. There is a work for you”, then do you think that they will respond nicely? They will respond, but you will have to do lot of work for that.', 'Alright. Because here many fake websites are there, many fake phone calls or messages are happening, so you have to do a lot of work to build the trust.', 'Afterwards.. Afterwards they will be able to do. They will respond.', 'Suppose we have started such kind of application and then we will need some investment for running the system. We would do the starting investment, but then there is the need for the running expenditure. It would be run by them only, \\xa0we will just come out of it. Then will they give some percentage of whatever they are earning out of it, so that the system can continue ? No.', 'No? You need to understand that when here comes a matter for giving a maintenance fee from the side of the society, \\xa0then itself they make a lot of noise. This is my point of view, but it may be a no.', 'Okay, may be no. But you can do survey in your own way and find out the data.', \"See do you know about the messages that we receive from the companies, like suppose if you had made a call to the customer care, then in next minute you would get a message by saying that ” You had spoken to this person. Then how is your experience? \\xa0Reply for that” . So will there reply? I used to reply. \\xa0I don't know about others.\", \"Will people over here reply or not? How will people over here reply? You try to understand that here majority of people don't know English, and messages would come in English only. So he won't even understand, that this is for this. Many a times such schemes get activated in their phone, \\xa0for which money would be getting deducted promptly. But they are not even knowing and would say like “ I had just done the recharge, then why it had got over?”. But they would not do the research to know that why it had got over.\", 'Is it youngsters or…. The percentage of of knowing English is very less in youngsters as well.', 'So messaging is cancelled. Yes.', 'Suppose there is coming a call with a recording asking that “ You had gone to this place. Then how was your experience? Press 1 for good. \\xa0Press 2 for bad  and press for for something else”. Then will there reply or disconnect? They may disconnect. \\xa0Who will listen to such a long talk?', 'Suppose if I call them directly and spoke, \\xa0then will they answer? Yes, \\xa0then maybe they will answer. If they just have to say yes or no, \\xa0then they may reply.', 'Right. Because company people are bombarding with calls like calls for survey, calls for this, calls for that. What do people get out of that?', 'That is true. And which language do they keep in the phone? Gujarati.', 'Everyone? Or do youngsters keep English? Those who understands English, keeps English. \\xa0But mostly everybody keep it as Gujarati over here.', 'And which are the languages that they know? Hindi and Gujarati.', 'Do they know reading and writing? They know to properly read and write in Gujarati. But in Gujarati itself there is different forms. Because in Gujarat the are many districts and villages, and according to that the language forms of Gujarati also keep changing and dialect will also change. At there whatever they speak, they can write. Mostly it is like that.', 'Changing the dialect is not a problem, but they know how to write. They can manage writing, but what I am trying to explain to you is…..', 'Okay, okay, I understood. Suppose if you want to ask “ Where did you go?”, \\xa0so in proper Gujarati it is said as “Kya gaya hata?”. But if you towards Mehsana, in their dialect it is said as “Chyo jyo to”. So while writing they would write that only as “Chyo jyo to”.', 'Yes, yes, I understood. But they know how to write. That was my question? What about Hindi? I don’t about writing Hindi. But they understand.', 'Can they read? Yes, they manage reading and they can speak as well. Thanks to Bollywood.', 'Yes, is TV there in everybody’s house? Yes.', 'Which are the other electronic devices that they have? Fridge, air coolers, fan, then iron box is there. Now majority of them have LCD and LED TVs in their house. Then phone is there.', 'How about the dish connection? Or is it cable? They have dish TV. Didn’t you see it \\xa0here hanging on the top?', 'I saw, but I had seen like after three house there would be one house which had that. Oh, is it like that? Then they might be having the set top box in the house or they might be having wires for the channels.', 'Yes. So they have set top box and dish. \\xa0And this fridge and all might be having in only few houses, right ? Or is it there in houses of majority of the people? It is there in majority of the people’s house. Nowadays everything has come.', 'How about cooler and AC? AC is very rare, but cooler is there in most people’s house.', 'We were talking about socializing. How would they socialize? Festivals are there. They celebrate and meet each other. They do socializing like that.', \"Do they celebrate festivals? Yes, \\xa0they use to gather together and do chitchats. They also have these normal methods of socializing like how we give our presence in somebody's ceremonies or go to somebody's house to have tea or coffee . See, nowadays people use to do all these things from outside itself, but these people do those at home. They use to visit each other’s house and thus they socialize.\", \"Do they have any internal problems? Yes, yes, \\xa0everything is there. Problems are also happening and lots of other things are also happening. Usually everybody here have the feeling that they have their own group and even when they shout, fight or do whatever with each other, that group should not be broken. Also it is because of this that the social awareness is not going beyond a certain extent, since they don't want to separate from their group. They have the feeling that “As the group is thinking in a certain way, we only will do accordingly. We want to stay with them only. They will only be there to come and stand by our side during our hard times. Who else will come? “.\", 'Do people over here use to visit each other’s house just to sit and chat? Everything is there.', 'Do they go? Yes, they go.', 'Do they give tea and all? Yes.', 'Is it mainly tea? They use to give everything like tea, water, snacks…', 'How about ice cream? Or is there no ice cream? Mostly, they don’t give ice cream.', 'How about juice? Only very less people would give juice. But mostly it is tea. You write the things which are used.', 'No, it will be recorded. So no problem. That is it. I think I have almost done. Next, I wanted to know about the problems prevailing over here. What are the internal problems that occurs over here? I have seen lot of fights here. When we go from here to the community circle or when sometimes Kiran Bhai is taking us for a round, I have seen lot of chaos. What is the reason for that? Do those fighting starts on small things ? It depends on what type of chaos you have seen. Here the clashes between ego is the main reason for the chaos. It may not happen every day. Over here dignity is the biggest issue.', 'But what I saw here and what I felt is that here the people is not ready to forgive with each other. People are not forgiving easily. They keep it their mind, right.', 'Yes. It is like….', 'So…. Okay, you complete first.', 'No, I am trying to say that the fighting is because of the fact that they are not ready to forgive with each other. After that, what was next?', 'Then what is the reason for that? That’s what I wanted to ask. I don’t see any superficial reason for that. What I feel is like, we don’t know that whether they are forgiving from their heart or not. It normally happens like if today they are fighting, then in tomorrow they will be together again. And if they are fighting again, then they would remember about the previous ones. So may be in their mind, on the level of the dignity, it may be going deep within. Suppose today if you used any bad words against me, that would go deep inside into my mind. Right ? I may not remember that in my daily life. They will connect socially again in their every day life. If they have done a fight in the morning, they will be together again in the evening. It is like that. If they are having a fight in the afternoon, then they will be together again in the evening. In two or three days, they will forget everything. But when they are fighting again, then they will remember about these old stories again. So this is only about the values know, where the work is needed to be done.', 'Change is required. In all societies.', 'Does alcohol play a role in this? No, I don’t think so because if you are doing a study about the educated people in the society, there also thing exist. Over here you can see directly everybody fighting outside. But if you are seeing other societies in the community, they are doing the same internally or it may be going on in a different way.', 'But here is it more because of that ? What I feel is, here the people are more expressive. They don’t do Dhambh.', 'What is meant by “Dhambh”? Please use little easier words know. What can be said for “Dhambh” ? May be sophisticated or pretend like trying to show what is not there actually.', 'Okay, they are not like that. Yes, people over here are not like that. As you see around you can see that, if a person is angry, then he expresses his anger and not like doing backbiting. People are more expressive over here.', 'Not like from behind? Because when I were roaming around over here, I had spoken to 2 to 3 families and I had felt that like suppose if there is a small thing like a lady has swept the house and kept the trash at a side. When we are having same wall for both the houses, you might keep it at the side of other person’s house. The person would not be saying anything at the time he is noticing it. And when the person is having alcohol at night, afterwards he would fight with that lady for this issue. There are only very few people who would not express directly and don’t have courage, and those people will speak only when they are under the influence of alcohol . But that cannot be considered as a general statement for all.', 'That is not a general statement? That’s very less. It is very rare.', 'Is there anything like the “Rule of goons” over here? That’s too much over here. There has happened a lot of murders. If you are going ahead to where our center is located, there is a ground. Lot of killing has happened over there as well.', 'Then what is the reason for that, as so many goons are over here and everybody is considering themselves as boss. I don’t think that I should speak about it over here. That’s not right because there are many reasons and I can’t say anything.', 'Then because of that there is causing some differences or harms. Is it so, according to what you have observed? Yes, it happens definitely. Harms happens and first of all, the girls are harmed. So they are not allowed to go out from the house. How much struggle we had gone through? I have the freedom that I can wear, what I want to wear. Because I have earned it . But if you are telling this to somebody outside, then they would tell like “Oh, what is there in that? You can wear, what is there special in that?”. Because they don’t have to earn that freedom. They have got their freedom right from their birth. Here you have to earn all that on your own. So mostly when the trouble comes, first of all the girls are affected.', 'So there are cases of molestation and teasing. Yes, it happens.', 'Does it happens now also? Yes, it happens. There is a need and that is why we are saying that we need to do classes for adolescents boys as well. So the new generation will grow as respectable, right from their childhood itself.', 'Do the girls come for studying? They are coming now. I will tell you about that also, before these girl’s classes were not sustaining with us and there are many reasons behind that. So that we have started again in December. And now we had started to do the picking and drop off for the group of girls by ourselves. So now they are sending them. But they don’t travel alone. But in that, there is a case of duality as well. But the main reason is the fear that they are having and this is why the parents are not sending them. For them it is a question of prestige, that “If anybody is teasing my daughter, then what about my prestige?”. It is like that.', \"Yes, \\xa0that's right. Okay, right now I am not remembering about anything more. I will now leave and go through the whole thing and if there is any question or anything that is need to be followed up, then I will call you. ok.\", 'Thank you so much. thanks.', '1 minute. What I feel is that you all are trying to do good for the people.', 'We are doing. But our project is such that the result would not be shown within 1 month. It will take at least 6 months. It does not matter whether it is taking 6 months for 6 years. But you are putting in an effort.', 'Yes, that is there. I will now ask you some basic details like some fill in the blanks. Okay?', 'In a \\xa0house, approximately how many people might be there who is 17 or younger than 17? I have no idea.', '0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or more than 4? Bigger than 17 years?', 'No,  younger than 17 years or 17 years. You need younger. They will be many. At least three would be there.', 'Okay. 3 would be there, okay. Who would be the head of the house, \\xa0male or female? Both, \\xa0means in some houses it will be male and in some houses it will be female.', 'Then what is their basic level of education? If you see in the older generation, then there would be no education.', 'So, is it like illiterate? And in new generation, \\xa0that is the generation which is before us, their education is up to primary level or up to 10th or 12th.', 'Okay. And in the present generation who are about 25 years right now, as over here everybody would get married at the age of 25, they would have reached up to 12th or graduation.', 'So is the head of the family is your aged people or the people who are in one generation above you? I told you know that here the work is done as per generation.', \"So that is the previous generation. Yes, it will be the previous generation. And in that also there are certain criteria that if the people in the previous generation is not working properly or if there is any problem in the family, \\xa0then the new generation would take the charge. So the new generation will get involved and would say that ”Whatever you are saying is right, but nowadays it would not do. So our generation wants to do it in this way” \\xa0For example, the previous generation tells to produce four kids, but the present generation tells like “No,  we cannot afford four kids. Everything has become so expensive and we are not able to earn so much. Then why should we have so many children?”. So even if there is a pressure from the previous generation, our generation will tell that ”No, we don't want”. So they have only one or two children. That means even if they are having only daughters, \\xa0they would do the operation. They won't keep producing more, by expecting for a boy child. There are many people like that.\", 'Then what is the household type, I meant to ask that whether they are labor or as self-employment? Both are there.', 'Mostly… Both are there.', 'Both are there? Okay. So what is the primary source for cooking? What is the main fuel used for cooking? Gas cylinder.', 'Cylinder LPG and not kerosene, primus or any other? They use to buy kerosene and keep it as a backup. If they are not getting cylinder on time, then they can cook using that.', 'Then how about dung, coal or any other…? As I told you before, \\xa0that is used by certain community. If it is winter and they want to make millet rotis, then everyone will use dung. But it produces lot of smoke know, so now people had reduced using that.', 'That means gas is there in everybody’s house. Mostly it is there.', \"Have you seen casserole or thermos in people's house? Yes, \\xa0it is there.\", \"So they keep it. Okay. We can say like, that the thermos is there in each and everyone's house. About 80 percent people have thermos. And even if it is not there, \\xa0they know that there is something called as thermos. They know about it.\", 'Alright. \\xa0Then how about VCD players or DVD players? Will it be there along with TV? Yes.', 'Okay. You tell me about phone and TV. Do they have landline phones? No.', 'No, only mobile. Okay. Then how about stitching machine? Mostly everybody has the stitching machine as well.', 'Okay. How about cupboard or dressing table? Only few people have the dressing table, but they have cupboards. They have safe.', 'They have safe? The safe which is made of iron sheets, like this. Everybody has safe like this in their house and on one side there would be a mirror and that works as a dressing table.', 'Alright. How about vehicles? They have vehicles.', 'Like.. They have cycle, motorbike...', \"Do they have cars? There is not much in four wheelers, \\xa0but in that you can count the Tempos.Right? But they don't have the kind of vehicle which we use for the pleasure ride. Mostly everybody has Activa, scooter…\", 'How many two wheelers they might be having in a house? They might be easily having 2. Minimum one or two would be there.', 'Do the people here have some kind of food habits, which you think is not good? There are many habits.', \"Like? They don't eat food on right time. This is also a bad habit. Also in morning as soon as they get up, \\xa0they would drink one or two cups of tea just like that. That is also a bad habit. That also need to be corrected. Then they used to eat the previous night’s roti on the next day morning, which creates acidity. That also need to be corrected. They use to eat more of chilli and oil. They know that we get acidity and gas due to that, but they like it so they eat it.\", 'Do the people here eat vegetarian or non-vegetarian? Both are there. \\xa0There are some who are vegetarian and there are some who are non-vegetarian. Maybe non vegetarians are more. Even if there is so much hot outside, there are people who would cook non vegetarian food and eat. Okay.', 'If we are making like that, then doctors will come to know about it directly. So neither doctor’s nor people’s time will be wasted. Is it for the community for which we are working?', 'Yes, that community and if we want to apply it in somewhere else then this would be the model, as this is the sample which we can apply. It is diabetes that is coming under the chronic diseases. But in this community diabetes is not a big problem.', 'Yes, that I know. It may not be there over here,  but it can be there at other places. Our sir is doing an entire research on diabetes and there can be many other things like the people may not be even knowing that they are having the problem of diabetes. Here the case is like that. As they are not doing the checkups, they think that they are not having diabetes. Yes, but we had got it done. During that in the first round, one of our anganwadi teacher was diagnosed with diabetes. You should have done her interview. She came to know about it when she had done her checkups in Manav Sadhna. Then we thought that lot of people might be having like this. So we did the checkups for lot of people. But fortunately not many people have got it. There were about 7 to 8 people for whom it was on borderline or there was a possibility to get the diabetes. So okay, no problem.', 'Do these people have to go and search for the job? Do they get it easily? Here at Akbhar Nagar they use to gather together every day. There is no guarantee that they would get work in every day. They have search for it know. So suppose if we are making a system on the phone, so that we get the people, who need those kind of skill, and them in touch with each other without an agent. Because here the contractor who comes to pick them would take a lot of money and these people would not be getting much in their hands. So like that direct contact and the security will make sure to get a job for them. Yes, okay.', 'So they don’t have to go and stand there. The message will come to the phone that “At this time you can come to this place and I will pick you up”. Yeah, many a times it so happens that they use to take their tiffin and go, and come back with that tiffin without getting any work.', 'Then this will become little easier for them in their lives. Yes.', 'For how many years you have been working in Manav Sadhna? This is 17th year.', '17 years? And which are the programs you are attached with? Right from the beginning I have been attached with the anganwadi program.', 'Anganwadi ? I had started as an anganwadi teacher and worked as the anganwadi teacher for about 3 years. But at that time Manav Sadhna had 4 to 5 anganwadis. In those, like how the children are being taught in the private preschools I use to teach the children and give them nutritious food as well . And at that time we were not as partners with the government. Since 2004, the Manav Sadhna and thus anganwadi has started its partnership with the Gujarat government. So from 2004 onwards, I had been worked as an anganwadi supervisor and from 2007 onwards I had been worked as an anganwadi coordinator. So right from the beginning I am attached with the program of anganwadi. And for last 2 years I am with Manav Sadhna’s International Volunteer Programme.', 'Okay, for the last 2 years. If we see a community, then approximately in a house, how many people would be there in a family? If they had come here by migrating from Gujarat itself, that is from the villages of Gujarat, then in one house there will be grandparents, a couple and minimum 3 kids would be there. So 7 or else you can say that a family would be of 5 to 9 people. Or if they had come here by migrating from U.P or Rajasthan, then those families are smaller.', 'Then they are smaller ? Yes, they are smaller because there would be only a husband, wife and their children. Grandparents and all would not be there. Hardly any would be there, like if they had migrated to here very long ago, then those people’s grandparents would also be there. Otherwise not.', 'Are almost everybody migrants over here? In slum, almost everybody is migrated. Mostly people had come here by migrating from Gujarat itself. And if they had migrated from other states, then most of them had came from U.P and Rajasthan. Many people use to come from these 2 states. Maharashtrians also come, but very few. Mainly it is from U.P and Rajasthan, since Rajasthan is closer to us and from U.P the people use to go to wherever they find the work. So people use to come here in search of job. But mostly people use to come here by migrating from the villages. For example, the people over here are migrated from the villages which are closer to the rivers of Ahmedabad, like you might be knowing the places like Mehsana, Kadi, Kalol or Mansa. In this slum, there are only a very few people who is from Saurashtra or from far off places which are about 300 or 400 kilometers farther. There may not be many people like that. They are very few. I am telling this as per my knowledge. So mainly people over here have come from the villages of Gujarat, Rajasthan and U.P.', 'Okay, U.P. Then in one house, do 3 generation stays together? Yes. If we see in the houses of Gujarat, then yes, mostly 3 generations would be there. It is good that nuclear families are not still formed there.', 'Is it good? Yes, it is good. There is a foundation that is needed for the family. You can see that where there are children, parents have to go out for work like if father is a mason, then he have to go out in the morning itself and mother may also go out to pick papers or to work at somebody’s place as a household maid. Then she also have to go out in the morning. Then who would take care of their children? Then children would be roaming around. But if in laws like grandmother, grandfather or any other are there, then they would take care of the children. They would make sure that the children would not be roaming around and there would be some differences in their values and culture as well.', 'Has it made a difference? Yes, and I feel that because of that only it is been sustaining like this. I am not seeing it in anywhere else, but it is not like the very dangerous slums like in somewhere else. This Tekro is not a that much dangerous slum. And obviously this difference is made by the grandparents. It must have made the difference means that the situation is still balanced. That is what I feel. I believe in this way because where there are nuclear family couples, they have to struggle with things like bringing kids to anganwadi, to keep them clean or to take care of their health as the child is alone and keeps roaming around. When the poor mother comes in the afternoon, she would cook something and feed the child. They would not be even knowing that where is the child, or whether he is wearing dirty clothes or he is hungry. If we want to bring the child to anganwadi, then the ladies who are working here as helpers have to go there, give bath to their child and would bring them here. But if grandparents are there, then at least they would take a little bit of care and so that when the anganwadi finishes, then the child would go back home and would not roam around in heavy sun. They would take that much care. If they are having a little bit of knowledge about nutrition, then if the child is falling sick or something, then they would take care for the child. And where there is only parents and their children, the child is not taken care.', 'Oh, the child is not taken care of. Then if the children are given advices like “Do not roam around in sun” or  ”Do not eat from outside”, the do the children listen to that? We don’t give advices to the children. But yes, if the children are coming to anganwadi, then we tell them like “See, these things are not good for eating” or “If we eat these things, this is what happens”. But mainly we have to talk to their parents, the mother.', 'No. When the parents or grandparents give advices to their children like “Do not roam around in the sun, you would fall sick” or “Do not eat outside, it is not good” , then? We are working for the children who are up to six years old. In that case there is not coming such a situation and they are not capable to understand that why they should not go out in sun or why they should not eat certain things. So we try to make them understand the things in a funnier way. Suppose they had pepsi, then we tell them that “See, you had got cold know. You are having that pepsi, right ? That is why it is happening. See you fall sick and got fever know. You ate this thing, right? So this had happened”. But our work is mainly with the child’s parents. We do this work of awareness with their parents. Children don’t understand these things. The child’s intelligence has not yet developed enough to understand what is right and what is wrong for them. We explain to their parents that “Why you are not hindering them from eating those Pepsi, Kurkure or that two rupees packet Paplu. As there is no nutrition in that, your money is getting wasted and your child’s health is getting spoiled. Then you will have to pay money to the doctor as well, because when the child eat things like Pepsi or other fried items, his health will get spoiled. Rather you send them to anganwadi, then your child will be taken care of , will get nutritious food, would sit here nicely for 3 or 4 hours and would learn something . ”', 'So up to six years means, the children who are only younger than 6 years use to come here ? Yes. In the anganwadi, the children are of age 0 to 6 years. They are our beneficiaries. So we do the work of awareness with the elder people.', 'In anganwadi there might be coming only children who are younger, but when you are talking to their parents, they may be sharing their problems with you, right? Yes. They tell us.', \"See they don’t have only a single child. Everybody has 2 or 3 children. So they may be giving advices to those who are elders, like 11 or 12 years old, and studying. So what I am asking is about those who are older and have developed little bit of understanding. Do they listen to their parents or will behave as their mind says? It depends on how much intensity you use to explain about these things to them or to their parents. These bigger children get knowledge from two sides. Those who come to Bal Sanskar Kendra in Manav Sadhna are older than 6 years. You might be knowing that for those who are from 1st standard to 6th standard there is a Bal Sanskar Kendra in Manav Sadhna. So the teachers in Bal Sanskar Kendra talk about these things to them. So they get information from the school and also we talk to their parents. But it is not like that the parents would always listen to us and do like that. We use to keep telling them everything, \\xa0but they also have their own excuses for not listening, not doing or not paying attention. But there are few parents who feel that “This is good for our child”, and they will tell to their children about that. And those children are different as well. But there are some parents to whom if we are tell that “You should not give such things” , then they would say that “What else will they eat? They would only eat such things when they cry. They do not listen as they are crying”.  See, the children don’t have that much understanding. I give them examples for that as well. Like when they say that “Bhabhie, they are crying as they don’t want to come today to Anganwadi”, “Bhabhie, he wants to eat Pepsi everyday”, “He wants to eat that Paplu which is of two rupees. He only wants to eat that.” or “He only wants to eat that colored fruit”. Then I use to tell them that “When a child falls sick, then you will have to take your child to the dispensary and give him injections or medicine. Then does he like that? He cries, right ? Then why are you giving it at that time?”. Then they say like “We have to do that know. When the child is sick we must do that. Otherwise how will he get cured?”. They I ask them “Then how do you force them at that time? At that time will you consider that whether he wants it or not? Do you ask him like whether he wants to have the medicine? Instead you give him, right? Then there is nothing wrong in forcing the child for this particular thing or explaining to him about these things. So there is nothing wrong in forcing him, to send him to Anganwadi. Initially you send him with force. \\xa0Actually we need to send him with love. But if he doesn't agree then force him initially, because once he sits there he is going to enjoy it. Then he will start to come by his own. But at least make them to start to come to Anganwadi initially.”\", \"So if the children are pressurized, \\xa0then they would agree. They can pressurize, \\xa0but in that we don't consider beating. Many times when they are not ready to come, they use to beat their children from in front of us itself. They would say that ”Bhabhie, you told us know to send him”. So we are not saying them to beat him and send. Instead of beating we can do the same by little bit of explanation or little bit of force. Once he starts coming for a month or 15 days, then he would understand by himself and he will enjoy. And it is our responsibility to create such an environment in Anganwadi, so that the child enjoys. So the responsibility is there from both the sides.\", 'Many times there would be having some internal problems in the family. It happens as everybody have problems. Then who must be knowing about those? I did not understand your question.', 'I mean in a family, definitely there would be internal problems. Everyone use to have. \\xa0Sometimes the problem would be between the husband and wife, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law or it can be like the children are not listening. Then is there anybody who is outside their family, who would be knowing about these things? And these people might be asking to them that “What to do?” The neighbors would be knowing. Whether these people are telling them or not, they would definitely knowing that what is going on in a family. Secondly, those who are in contact with them on a daily basis, somebody like Anganwadi teachers or Anganwadi assistant teachers, they know about it. Also there are lane workers of the government, they use to know about it. If ladies are having a problem like husband is beating or mother-in-law is troubling, then they might go and tell to their friend in the neighborhood or to any lady from the village as they are from the same village. So they would share with her that such things are going on. Also they use to share with the Anganwadi ladies.', 'When considering ladies, how is the relationship between the mother and their child? Children means boys or children in general?', \"Children in general. As I talk about relationship, it is very complicated to understand. Because the loving relationship between the parents and their children are there only in very few families. It is not like that they don't care for their children or don't love their children. But their way of showing love and care is different. But there are only a very few families where there is unity or love, and those give love to their child, won’t beat the child and the wish of the child is also considered. Whereas in most of the families it is like that “The children have to do whatever we say”, ”We can beat them”, ”We can behave in the way we want to behave with them” or \\xa0“We can speak anything in front of them”. So there is not much awareness about the values and the culture that needs to be passed on to them. Like they are not aware of the thing that whatever we do or whatever we speak is noticed by the children or what will happen to his future if he is not going to school or what will happen to his health if he is eating such type of food.  So these types of worries and care are less. And it is because of the atmosphere in which they have stayed and grown, considering the parents as well . I think that they have less of those feelings or awareness that the first and foremost duty of a parent is to pass good value and culture to their kids. It is their first responsibility and that is less there. So for them the loving relationship with the children or opening up the relationship when the children is becoming young, whether it is boys or girls, are very less. There it is like a one sided relationship that parents are superior and the children have to follow them. Parents can beat them or behave in the way they want to behave. It’s been thought very less that the children also have their self-respect.\", 'Do the children got controlled by them? If they are growing up in this kind of atmosphere, \\xa0then once they have grown up then they would not be got under control. Because once they have grown up, they would also behave in the same way as their parents. Suppose if there is a boy, as he has seen and experienced only that, then he would behave in the same way with his wife when he is getting married. So in that atmosphere whatever they have got, \\xa0they are giving it to others.', 'They see and learn. Yes.', 'So what should they do to make the children listen to their advices? We are working on that as well. In Anganwadi we are working with the mothers of the young girls. You won’t believe that in slums there are causing unexpected pregnancies in young girls as they are getting abused by a family member who are closer to their family, by young boys or elderly men from the community. And their knowledge about the reproductive health is very limited. And also there are many incidents happening in the community that the girls of hardly 17 years old use to run away with somebody.', 'Oh, so she runs away. Is it? Yes, \\xa0because they feel like this is love and this person might be there for whole life. So she runs away and then the boy leaves her after a month. Then she has to come back home. Most of the times she might be pregnant. So we are working with their mothers to tell them “What kind of relationship should you share with your daughter?”, ”Why don’t you send them to school?”. So we enquire them that \\xa0”Why are you beating them” or ”Why don’t you trust her?”. We used to talk to their mothers,  since when their daughters reach to 7th or 8th class they use to leave their education and when we ask why, they would say like “Now she had become young and as she goes out she would meet some boy and might fall in love and runs away. You know that these things are happening ”. Then we use to tell them that “They are falling in love not because of that they are going out. Why your daughter is not sharing things with you?”. Also we make them understand that this age is like that. The adolescents is such an age….', 'Yes it is the mindset. Yes, \\xa0since there are a lot of changes happening and they will be having lot of questions. They may not be able to tell or cannot even bear it. So your relationship with your daughter should be in such a way that she should be able to tell you everything. If you give her love, if you give her respect or if you make her study, then she would be able to understand. And because of that understanding she would think before taking any wrong steps. So we are working with the girls and also with their mothers. We use to explain to them that “What kind of relationship should you share with your daughter ? What your children need? \\xa0They want love. How they would feel if you are beating them or pressurizing them?”. When mother beats her child I would always tell the mother that “Right now you are the role model your child and you are beating her. You are beating and so he would only see that and would think like my mother used to do like that, so I can also do like that or that is the right thing. Then tomorrow he also starts to beat you. Today you have beaten him and tomorrow he is going to beat you. Or if sometimes some incidents are occurring, then he would not even think before beating you or his wife, because you are doing that right now. So you are giving him that”. There is a saying know “Whatever is there in the well, \\xa0will only come to the pool” . So if you are giving them love, nice environment and good values, then it will open up in him. But if you are giving a negative  environment for your child or if you are putting a wrong example by your own behavior that “no need to give love for your child and behave as if  he is your property”, then children also will behave in the same way to you when they grow up.', \"So if the children are having problem like that, that to where do they go and tell? Or are they not able to tell anybody? Unfortunately I don't know much about boys. There are some boys who come to Manav Sadhna, then they might be talking to their teachers. But I don't know much about that. Unfortunately I don't know much about boys, because we are working with girls. We are closer to girls.\", \"I meant children in general, those who are unmarried. It can be male or female. I don't know much about boys, because I have not worked with boys. But for girls, \\xa0first of all they cannot tell anything to anybody. So they are confused as to where they should go. At the most she would have a friend to whom she can talk to and she also may not be knowing much about things like why this is happening or what should I do for a particular thing. First of all they have not even got education, also there is not such an atmosphere in their house where there is a person who can give right advice to them. So there is nobody in their surroundings. Till there was not Anganwadi and we have started doing the programs for girls, it was like that. But now there is Anganwadi and our program for girls, so at least the girls try to reach the ladies of the Anganwadi and talk to them.\", \"Don’t they feel shy while talking? Now they don't feel shy at all or it is less. Initially how much ever you try, they would not even talk. Also now if the girls are going to school and she is having a good relationship with her teacher, then she would talk to her teacher as well. They also use to talk to the Anganwadi teachers. Before, \\xa0even when they have got abused, they would not tell to anybody. They feel shy for that as well. As they have grown up in such an environment they feel like it is their fault or if they are trying to tell to someone, everybody would point at them. So because of so many reasons they would not tell to anyone. But now many times it has been happened like we had come to know through an Anganwadi teacher, that such things are happening with that girl.\", 'If we are considering a family, in that there are parents, children and all. Then is there somebody outside the family, whom they believe as their well-wisher or something like that? Outside the family, mainly it is the father whom the child can say that “I can talk to my father”, where the relationship is good and the atmosphere is loving.', 'But that happens very rarely, right? There would be very rare cases like that. Yes, it is very rare. Then otherwise they would tell to their friends, with whom they use to sit and spend time. They believe them to be their well-wishers. Or if they are going to school, then to their teachers.', 'Okay, teachers. Teachers are there. Anganwadi sisters are there. And the people those who are not going to school, like doing some work and has left the school or those who has not joined any institutions like Manav Sadhna and are not going to school, so for them their friend or whomsoever is there, is the place where they share their problems or express themselves. And the friends are also mostly the same.', 'So among these people, do they have such relationship where they won’t be able to say “no” to each other? Suppose if there is something needed to do, then for that. Generally there use to happen things like, that if a person comes to me and say that “I need this”, then even if I can’t do that, I would not say “no” to that person, as the relationship is that much close. Like see if you have come, I will do the work that you need, since there is that much of respect and love. That kind of thing might be there in boys.', 'In boys or in family or in parents, like that anywhere may be such things, right? Yes. There are some relationships which are like that in which you can’t say “no”.', 'Can you give some example of with whom do they have such a relationship? In girls, it is like that they may say “no”, because among girls, her friend might not be having that kind of a situation from which she can put her foot forward and help the other. So even if she wanted to do, she can’t do anything because she has her own limitations. But such things might be there in boys. It is there always. For example, when the kitchen of Anganwadi from Manav Sadhna was going on, the community boys used to work with us. They were all friends of each other. They all help each other in wrongful deeds.', 'Okay right. We ask them like “That fellow did like that, then why did you do like this?”. Then he says “Sister, when he told me, I was not able to say no”.', 'So that means, friendship? Yes. They used to say like “He makes me sit for gambling or other things”. Such things are there.', 'How about parents? I can’t say about the case of parents.', 'Okay. Then I will you one example. In Punjab, in the village communities, they use to have a leader for a community and if he says that this needs to be done in this way, then it will happen in that way only. Nobody can refuse him, either it could be with fear or it could be with respect for that leader. They have that much trust and they feel that this person is thinking for their benefit only. Here also I know that in every slum community there is some or the other leader, to whom these people would listen to. For example, some spiritual leader may be there. So, they use to listen to that person as well.', 'Is there any such person like as you said , any special person? What do you mean by leader? They are religious leaders like a Baapu. So they have this kind of things.', 'So that is there. Yes. They have Baapu for 6 villages or 7 villages.', 'Yes. Do they have like that? Do they have Baapu for 6 villages,7 villages or 14 villages? Yes. They have such things. They have colonies and so as per their colony they have their own Baapu or more than Baapu, they have those people who is known as Bhuva (exorcist).', 'They have Bhuva also? Yes. In this community they have Bhuva. They do a lot of things with their fear for Bhuva. If Bhuva says them that you can’t do family planning operation, then they won’t do. Even if they die, they will not do. If Bhuva says then they feel that there is nothing wrong in smoking or drinking alcohol and they will do that.', 'Is it like that? Yes, and if Bhuva says you shouldn’t eat non-veg, then they will not eat. But if Bhuva says that you can eat, then they will eat.', 'Doesn’t Bhuva give any good advice? I don’t know. That is how she became Bhuva, right? Because they don’t give good advice.', 'Yes. It could be like that. I feel that as they are not giving good advice, they have become Bhuva.', 'So, he speaks what people wants to hear. Yes. He knows what these people would like to hear. That is why he is a Bhuva. But I can’t call him spiritual because those are good people. But this Bhuva behave as per their selfishness. I don’t know why there is more of Bhuva culture here. I feel that way. Those Bhuva are there, then they have these goddesses.', 'Do these Bhuva take money? Yes. Definitely they must be taking. They take money for Padhramani or for putting Dhaana (ritual with seeds), or for seeing Dhaana. They also have goddesses. These Bhuva put Dhaana and they see Dhaana. I don’t know what they do. I don’t know what it is called. God only knows. Those things are too much over here. In some community like Vaghri community, we can’t manage because of these goddesses and Bhuva. And those Bhuva use to tell them only things like not to do family planning and all. Suppose if a lady has 4 kids and her body has got exhausted because of that and the lady will be almost dying, still she would be having 6th kid in her belly. We are tired of explaining them, but they would say “no, as our goddess is saying no”. We use to tell them that “If you die, do this goddess takes care of these 6 kids?”. They listen to them this way. Then I ask them, “Isn’t your goddess saying no to your husband drinking alcohol?”. He was laying there by drinking alcohol and this lady have her 6th kid in her belly. Recently in the house of Aruna Ben where there is only a small room which is almost half of this room, there are 5 to 6 kids and husband and wife. 8 of them stay together in that small room. Even there is no light in that house. That lady was telling me that her goddess has said her “no”. Her husband uses to lay there 24 hours by drinking alcohol. We asked her that doesn’t her goddess told him to not to drink alcohol.', 'Then does she understand when you said all these things to her? No. She doesn’t understand and she speaks to me sometimes rudely as well. She says like “Go away, you big educated lady”. Many times she used to ask us to go away, but sometimes she use to listen and laughs. Sometimes she gets angry, and sometimes gets confused. Sometimes even I get angry and will say her “What you are saying Goddess, goddess. All your children will die like that”. When I say like that as I am angry, then she says “Okay you go away !Why should I listen to you ? Are you helping me to see my end?”. Sometimes these things happen. Sometimes she keeps laughing. Even if we get angry on her, she keeps laughing.', 'Okay. Then that might be her mood? Yes, that is on her mood.', 'Do they have problem like monetary problems? Yes, definitely. For those who have more children, when the government or people from government or anganwadi or other good people tell them to do good things, they don’t want to listen at any time and don’t want to follow it in their lives. And there is always improvement in the lives of those who understands a little bit or those who have less children or those who are connecting these awareness work about what is going on in this world. You can immediately see those differences in their lives.', 'How many families might be there like that? There is a whole community which is different like that.', 'But such people are very less know? If you see the overall scenario. Yes, such people are less.', 'If you have to tell in percentage, then how many percentage you will say? if you have to say a number in percentage, then ? We are working with 79 communities through 79 anganwadis. Then in that I can say 30 communities would be like that, where we tell them and they will listen, they will come in meetings and they have less children as well. I can show you that kind of communities. It is completely different and after telling once or twice the work is done in those community. And those who are not listening at all, where we have lot of struggle, they don’t want to listen at any cost and there the work is done by even after telling 25 times. For example, if we go from here then Chandrabhaga Mokhado comes. So there, we have to struggle the most. Then there is one more area which is ours, that is Sabarmathi, where we have 33 anganwadis. There are also many areas where we have to struggle. Just opposite to that, there are good areas as well, like Chaul of MPs. If you see there, they have less children and parents are little bit educated. They are ready to listen to whatever anganwadi teachers say. They comes regularly in the meetings , would listen whatever we says , take care for if we have told them anything for children , come for vaccination, do deliveries  in hospital and use to send children regularly for studying. So if you see their lives it is completely different.', 'So as you said not everybody do the delivery in the hospitals? Yes, there are certain communities like the community which is near the Chandrabhaga Mokhado. We have 3 anganwadis there as we go from here.', 'Where we have our community center, there? It is before community center.', 'Okay. You have to get down to Khado.', 'Is it on the way as we go from here? No! Not from here. It is on that side, after getting down from the bridge. In that community we have to struggle a lot. They don’t go to hospitals because this Vaghri community is there know, which I had told you, that they believe in goddess and Bhuva .They would say that their goddess say them that they are not supposed to go to hospitals and so they cannot go to hospitals.', 'So that is the only reason? Yes, that is the reason and they say we cannot go to the hospitals. So this Vaghri community is the community with whom we are still struggling. Also where there are Adivasi people (the aboriginal tribal peoples) who have migrated from UP. But they have started atleast by now. Many of them have started understanding, so now there is lot of change in them. But with this Vaghri community, we are struggling the most. I can say that when we started the anganwadi in 2004 with Manav Sadhna, at that time suppose there are thousand deliveries done, then out of that half of the deliveries were done in hospitals and half of the deliveries were done at home. But now the ratio has increased to 80 to 90 percent. But still we are struggling with this Vaghri community mainly.', 'Do they had any problems while giving childbirth like the still born child or …? Yes, they face such problems, like the child would be severely malnourished or the mother would face problems. Mother almost gets on the verge of dying and get saved.', 'On the verge of dying and saved? Yes, recently that’s what happened. In Chandrabhaga itself, the ladies of anganwadi did lot of running around and with lots of difficulties saved that lady.', 'Right. Then we take that opportunity to explain them that how this lady was almost dying and then got saved. She was refusing but still doctors were called by dialing 108 and immediately she was taken to hospital. Then she was saved with so much of difficulties. Because the lady had started bleeding from home itself and she was all alone at home. The husband was available nowhere. The sister of anganwadi went immediately to the doctor and got the note written from the doctors and called the ambulance and had sent her to VS hospital. Then she was saved with lot of difficulties. She delivered a baby boy. So again, we tell them these things with lot of emphasis by saying that “See, you would have died and now you are saved”. But still if they want to listen, they would listen. Actually no. They would listen and they would say “Yes sister I would. We must write our name in the hospital”. But we only come to know when the anganwadi lady goes there in the evening or night and visits her. If the sisters are there, then they would try to send her to hospital by calling ambulance. But if it has happened in night or after evening then they use to say that “Sister! It started to happen only now at home”. Is this like as going to toilet to say that it just happened?', 'Okay! So still they do not understand. Yes, they would say that it happened at home. So basically, they don’t want to go. Also there is an increase in the rate of institutional delivery as well. One of the reasons for that is there are lot of government policies in which they get money, like if you do delivery in hospital, then you get money. You don’t have to pay a single penny and on top of that you get money.', 'Is it like that? Yes, also you get an ambulance which will take you to hospital and also it will come to drop you back at home. And if any child is having any problem after birth, then child would be kept there and the pediatrician is called and all the treatments are done. The treatment for measles is done as well. So these are the advantages. We explain to them these things that “If you do delivery at home and if suddenly some complications come, then it happens like this” and so many a time mothers have died also. When we started in 2004 at that time, in one year there were about 18 to 19 maternal deaths.', '18 to 19? Yes, when I did first reporting of 2004, there were 19 maternal deaths at that time. I still remember. This year there is not a single death.', 'That means progress is there but that is slow. Yes, progress is there but it is slow. Last year there were 2 deaths. This year there is not a single death. So there is a difference.', 'Then there are many other government schemes also, know? Like skill development schemes or Kaushalya Talim or for men they teach little bit of garage work or teach stitching work to ladies. Then do these people take advantage of such schemes or no? They take. But compared to boys, girls take more advantage. Boys also take advantage, but I don’t know why. But I feel that these skill development schemes of government lack something due to which the boys take the training but they don’t get the work .May be that provision is not proper, because there have been so many examples in which it has happened that after taking training under these skill development schemes they don’t get the work due to some reason or maybe they themselves have not tried much. So they don’t get job and they would say that this training does not help in any way. And for the girls as well, even though they participate the most in the skill development programs, they don’t do anything afterwards. They would say that they did beauty parlor course, or they have learned to make bags. They say like that but what next? Government keeps telling that they will give the material and you just make and if you make nicely, we will create the marketing facilities. But you have to keep patience in everything as it takes time. But for whatever reason these people don’t have that patience. They have set this concept in the mind that I have taken training under skill development, so from tomorrow onwards I should start earning 2000 rupees. And this mentality is there in girls as well as boys. Many times, I had felt like for boys this skill development programs needs to be redesigned, where they are also told and taught that it is not only about developing skills. They need to be told as how to do work after that on your own. For example, suppose a person learns plumbing. If you see nowadays there is so much of demand for plumbing. If you see in my house also, there is a plumbing work to be done, but we are waiting for 15 days .But we don’t get plumber as there is so much demand for them and if you see around, plumbers are earning around 700 rupees per day. Do you know that? For plumber it is 700 rupees per day.', 'Is it 700 rupees? Yes, it is 700 rupees per day. So for them, they can get a lot in less hard work.', 'That makes to 20 to 21 thousand per month? Yes, right. So, they learn plumbing, but after that they have to learn to make some connections, contacts and you have to develop trust as well. If you create connection, then here in Manav Sadhna itself, plumber is required in every day. There are so many institutions of ours itself. There we don’t have even one official plumber. So you can think about, for the boys who have learned with us how much work we can give to them. But they don’t have patience or sometimes they don’t have commitments towards work. So, these things also should be taught in skill development program.', 'So there are many schemes which gives jobs like placement agencies. No doubt that they would take some money. Also there are NGOs like Manav Sadhna who help them to get work. Don’t they ask work from them? Asking for work! See first of all I will tell you the truth. There are few boys or girls who would go to people on their own. I am telling you that when a person comes twice or thrice to Manav Sadhna, then they might work for free of cost also ,may be only twice .Then in the case of electricians, there is a lady who comes to anganwadi, her husband is an electrician, so if I have any small work, then I would call him immediately . Your efficiency and commitments also count to that. Like if I call you today at 10’o clock, then you should come at 10 ‘clock. Like if I use to come after two hours and make people wait like that or everybody sitting and waiting for you, then? So, there is lack of such seriousness in boys.', 'That’s right. You should know how to make connections. You will get work with help of connections. Then the character, honesty, it’s like all together.', 'Yes, all that is alright. All that comes into picture later, only after they get the job. Do they take the help of these institutions to get the job? Boys on their own?', 'Boys or gents or ladies or anybody. They are very few.  I am telling you know, there are very few who would come and ask for work.', 'Then what is the reason for why they don’t ask? (To Interviewer 2) Do you want to ask  something?', 'You were talking about connections. So I want to ask that suppose these plumbers and all are there and they are not able to make connections. Then what is the problem in that? I feel they are not able to make connections because if they have made connection, for example, I know the ladies of my anganwadi. If husband of anyone of them is doing plumbing work, then I would know about it and if call him once or twice and I feel that this person is doing good job, then I would tell about him to five other people that you must call him. So like that work can be carried on.', 'Yes, work is done like that only. There will be mouth publicity. Like if comes on time and he does work properly then I feel that he is honest. He may also charge the money reasonably, then I would tell about him to some other person also. Everybody needs know. He or the other says, “I want carpenter. Please get my work done”. I know as I am here at this place. People keep asking me that “I want this, I want that”.  Volunteers keep asking me that where to give laundry. Then I can tell others, I can tell ten people like “Do you want electrician? Please call this person”. But when will I say? When their work is efficient and they have to keep connection with me. I may forget. But see there is an electrician who keep asking me that, “Sister, is there any work there? Let me know if it is there”. So, he doesn’t give me a chance to forget. So, these things should be there in boys. But somewhere that is missing.', 'So, they should have their own skills also. Yes, and little bit of patience should be there, that I would get work. Let it start at least, like once the train is on the track, then it is definitely going to run. But there is a starting problem. Many a times what happens is that, see in these boys or people of Tekra, there is the issue of commitment. If there is some marriage or somebody’s death, then they would go away for 15 days. They go to village. They will not even call and inform. The communication is also very poor from their side. Communication is so poor, that suppose if I say that, “See I called you today at 10’o clock”. Then he would say that, see in my house this is what happened, or I would have guests in my house, so I could not go out. It is okay, but you have to at least call and inform. So then because of such problems, the feeling is that these people are like this only and so we don’t want to call anybody from Tekra. These people have this kind of issues. Every time some social thing would be going on. Somebody dies or some marriage would be there, so they go away for 10 to 15 days. Like we have one Kaushik Bhai. We took him recently in our health area. He came and after 15 days he asked for leave saying that “I have to go to village for 10 days, because there is a marriage”. So, he went for 10 days to his village. So these things happen and I suspect that how it is going to work. If just now you have come and you take 10 days leave for marriage, then how the work will be done? In my house some plumbing work is pending, then electrician did half of the work, for rest half he said I will not come for ten days. Then how will I recommend that you call this person.', 'Yes, the other person should feel the satisfaction about the work. Yes, there has to be commitment. Commitment and efficiency, both are needed. And honesty as well, that whatever money you are charging has to be reasonable as per prevailing rates. Suppose if somebody’s work is very good and when they are charging too much, then also I can’t recommend.', 'Yes, that’s also true. But my original question is still there that why don’t they ask for help? Because once they ask for help, then the next things are in your hands, as you would see the quality of his work and then give him the work. First of all they are not even asking for help and there must be some reason behind it or don’t they even know that you can help them? First of all, I feel that they would not be having any idea that if we are taking this type of approach, then we would get work. Also, secondly it is because of “Laghuta granthi”(inferiority complex). What is the other word for that…?', 'I don’t know what “Laghuta granthi” is. Is it maximum? No minimum.', '“Lagu”. Yes, tell me the meaning of “Laghuta granthi”.', '“Lagu” is minimum. But what is “Laghuta granthi”? If you explain that to me, then I can tell what it is called in English. “Laghuta granthi” means they discourage themselves. For example, they think like “I am from Tekra, and therefore will I get work over here or no”.', 'Okay, they don’t have confidence. Yes, they don’t have that confidence, whether people will give them work or not. Or if I go there will they even allow me to stand there. So, like that they don’t have the communication skill or the confidence to express themselves.', 'So, they don’t have confidence. Yes, like today a person can go and talk in an office or they would come here and talk to me. Many a times they would stand very far and talk to me from there. So that is missing. They don’t have that.', 'Do they feel shy? No, more than shy it is the lack of confidence. Sometimes it is because of this “Laghuta granthi” or inferiority complex and many a times it is also caused because of superior complex that “Why should I go?”.', 'Okay, that is also there? Yes, they would think that “I have learned and now everybody would come and ask me”. That is also there. They would be sitting there at pan shop. But these kinds of things are very less.', 'Is it so that they don’t have trust? On whom?', 'On the institutions which might help them to get the job or don’t they  even know these types of institutions exists. Yes, lack of information is also there. They don’t have the knowledge of these things that we can also do these kinds of things and these people can help them to get work also or if they had done some production then for marketing, people are available. They don’t know these things.', 'Do they have trust on these NGOs and all these institutions? They don’t trust all the NGOs but if something is told by Manav Sadhna, then they would trust it. But if there is somebody unknown, whom they don’t know much, or even if the government people come and tell, they don’t trust them, because the community will trust you only if you are getting attached to the community.', 'Then what is the reason that they trust you people and not the others? Manav Sadhna is working with them from last 25 years. See, among them Manav Sadhna has connection with the community. Whereas the government people don’t have that kind of connection. Then how will they trust?', 'If we try to see, what is the general job on overall Tekra? General jobs, mostly everybody is on daily wages and labor works. In that there are doing mason workers, autorickshaw drivers and also there are some people, which I feel around 10% of people, might be doing government job as well.', 'If we try to see, what is the general job on overall Tekra? Yes, in Torrent.', 'If we try to see, what is the general job on overall Tekra? Yes, they work in Torrent.', 'Then what is their work over there? As an electrician or they work in government as peon or as a cleaning labor, also doing delivery of gas cylinders. Lot of young boys go for doing delivery of the cylinders because you get more money in that and in that you can cheat also, like emptying half of gas cylinders and then…Such things do happen. So young boys mostly go in that way, because they get more money per day, even by doing faulty deeds.', 'How about ladies? Mostly ladies go as house maids and they also go to pick the papers from the garbage.', 'Only these two? Yes, mostly these two only. Is it so (to other lady)?', 'Only these two? Also in kitchen.', 'Only these two? In the kitchen means?', 'Only these two? At that place.', 'Only these two? But that is seasonal only, know?', 'Only these two? Yes, seasonal.', 'Is it the job of cooking? No! No! Not cooking. Like suppose there is a marriage then….', 'Okay, in a marriage, to work in the kitchen? Yes, in a marriage, to serve people or to cut the vegetables. They go for doing these kinds of works.', 'If you see, how much they might be getting as an income? Either monthly or daily or as how, do you have any approximate idea? Monthly, they earn upto 6000 to 7000 per month. Isn’t it? (to other lady)', 'If you see, how much they might be getting as an income? Either monthly or daily or as how, do you have any approximate idea? Yes, it is around 300 rupees.', 'If you see, how much they might be getting as an income? Either monthly or daily or as how, do you have any approximate idea? No, for the masonry work, it is 700 rupees per day.', 'If you see, how much they might be getting as an income? Either monthly or daily or as how, do you have any approximate idea? Not like that. I am saying about those who are going for the labor work.', 'If you see, how much they might be getting as an income? Either monthly or daily or as how, do you have any approximate idea? And for those who are going for the masonry work earn around 10,000 rupees per month. And those who are on daily wages get around 6000 or so. And the ladies who are speaking papers from the garbage,\\xa0earn around 3000 rupees per month. 3000 or 4000. They would earn 3000 for sure. The ladies who are going as housemaids also earn around 2500 to 3000 rupees. Rickshaw drivers earn around 8000 to 10000 rupees', \"Right. So, they don't have too much of the financial problems. There are problems in some of the families. But it is not like that they don’t even have food to eat. They have electronic devices in their houses, have cell phones and have smartphones as well. They have T.V, cooler and also have vehicles.\", 'Then in a day how many times the meals are made? Twice or thrice. Isn’t it? They must be making it twice for sure or when there is a guest for them, then they might be making for three times.', 'What are the timings? Lunch and dinner.', 'Not in the morning? In the morning they used to make bhakri along with tea.', 'Not in the morning? No, mostly they use to eat roti, that is fried roti.', 'Not in the morning? Yes, \\xa0they have that in breakfast. They use to put lot of oil and make bhakri. Also they use to put lot of salt in it. They like that.', 'Not in the morning? There will be also poori from outside.', 'So it is a fried thing. Then what do they cook in the afternoon and in the evening? They cook roti, Sabji and kichdi.', 'What? \\xa0roti and sabji? See here there are Patni community people. They all make Chatni. They grind red chilli and garlic, and make a liquid kichdi made of toor dal.', 'What? \\xa0roti and sabji? Do they have that in lunch?', \"What? \\xa0roti and sabji? Yes in the afternoon around 12 o'clock or 1 o'clock.\", 'What? \\xa0roti and sabji? Yes, so there are different patterns in that. She is now saying about those Patni.', 'Patni means from where do they belong? Dantani and Patni is there know. Those people.', 'Patni means from where do they belong? Those are one of the communities in Vaghri and they do the work of selling vegetables and all.', \"Patni means from where do they belong? Many people used to do the cooking in morning and in the evening they need to go out by taking the cart. So they cook around 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock, \\xa0together for both the times. They eat lunch and then they take the food with them.\", 'Patni means from where do they belong? So there are different communities. \\xa0For example these ladies are from the anganwadis of the Sabarmati area and these people have pattern like this. And the people from Rajasthan have a different pattern for eating food. \\xa0Those who have migrated from villages of Gujarat have a different pattern for eating food. What do Rajasthan people eat?', 'Patni means from where do they belong? Dal and roti.', 'Dal Bati? Yes.', 'Dal Bati? Yes, they eat dal and roti.', \"Okay, they eat dal and roti. That means the dal bati is there know. \\xa0So like that they make Bati. But that won't be there everyday.\", 'Okay, they eat dal and roti. Yes, That will not be made everyday. But dal and roti will be definitely there.', 'Okay, they eat dal and roti. Yes, they make too much of dal and roti.', 'They cook in that way both the times. Yes, they have more usage of dal.', 'They cook in that way both the times. They need dal mandatorily.', 'Will the dal be on the sweeter side or as spicy? No, it will be with a lot of chilli and not like the Gujarati dal.', 'Will the dal be on the sweeter side or as spicy? It will be with a lot of chilli and not like the Gujarati dal.', \"Will the dal be on the sweeter side or as spicy? They don't even taste the Gujarati dal.\", 'Will the dal be on the sweeter side or as spicy? It will be so spicy that even by seeing itself we will get the feel.', 'As far as the job is concerned, \\xa0first of all they lack self confidence. Yes.', 'Also they lack discipline. Self confidence and secondly they don’t have knowledge as well.', \"They don’t have knowledge as well. Even if they get that, \\xa0they don't have discipline. Yes, even if they get, I won't say that everybody don't have discipline. But on an average to a lot of extent, that commitment or sincerity is missing, like if today I have got a work, so what should I do to keep getting work in future as well. For that we need to make connections, should be sincere and should reach on time if there is a commitment on time. If you are doing that much, then who will not give you work? People are looking for somebody who would do work.\", 'That means if somebody really want to work, then there is no lack of opportunity. Yes, I don’t \\xa0feel that there is lack of opportunities. Where I am staying, \\xa0everyday some or the other call use to come, asking like “ we need a plumber”,” we need a carpenter”,”we need like this” and all. Right now we don’t have a proper builder as well. We have constructed so many buildings and still we are looking for a builder. So it is like that.', 'Now if we see their food habits, \\xa0there are children, their parents and the older grandparents. Will there be any difference in their food or cooking will be done same for everybody? What is it?', 'Food is cooked same for everybody know. Yes.', 'Then what if somebody is falling sick, the food is same or something different is cooked for that person? For that person they might make different kichdi.', 'Then what if somebody is falling sick, the food is same or something different is cooked for that person? It is the same way like how we use to do. Suppose if somebody is having diabetes, \\xa0then for them we will use less sweet or would remove sugar or jaggery from their food, right? They also do like that.', 'Then what if somebody is falling sick, the food is same or something different is cooked for that person? They will keep the food separate and would add jaggery or sugar accordingly.', 'Is it so that for themselves also they will remove or reduce sugar? No, \\xa0they are very particular about their taste.', \"Is it so? Yes, spicy means they have to eat spicy. In so much of heat as well, \\xa0they eat so much spicy food that when I am trying to eat that food I may feel giddy. They eat that much spicy food. How much ever monetary problem they are having, \\xa0irrespective of that they want to eat it by putting so much of oil. They put too much of oil in things like Bhakri or fried things. They will definitely eat like that and for that they would do how much ever hard work they need to do, even if they are having some problems or are suffering. Also they face lot of problems because of that like stomach problems or piles. But they don't compromise on their food habits.\", 'Do they know that they are having these problems because of having this kind of foods? Once they are starting to have those problems they come to know about it.', 'But after that do they stop or continue eating? When they are having too much of trouble, \\xa0then they may reduce a little bit. Then they will start again and would say that “We cannot do without this”.', 'Okay. So they come back to the square. Yes. Isn’t it?', 'Okay. So they come back to the square. Yes, they just keep eating those things like Samosa or things like that. If not in the house they might go out and eat.', 'Is it so? In about 99 percent of the slum, there is unhealthy eating habits.', 'Alright. In that comes eating spicy food, \\xa0fried food,  too much of sweets or eating too many chillies.', 'How much of sugar do they use? They use it in making tea.', \"Is it only in tea, \\xa0nothing else? That is true. Like how we spoke about dal, when I make dal in my house, I use to add jaggery in that. Whereas they drink very sweet tea and what this lady is telling is right. They drink very sweet tea and won’t use sugar or jaggery in any other cooking. They don't eat sweets as such. Whatever meals they are eating, \\xa0in that they won't add sweetness. They need those with full of chilli. The sweetest thing that they have is in the form of tea.\", 'How many times do they have tea in a day? 3 to 4 times.', 'How many times do they have tea in a day? They keep drinking saucer after saucers, as how much time people come. For example, if you go, they would make tea for everybody and if I go, again they would make tea for everybody. So how they are saying, \\xa03 to 4 times in a day  for sure.', 'Okay, it will be done 3 to 4 times. They get it from outside only.', 'Do they buy tea from outside? Yes, there is different patterns for that as well.', 'Do they buy tea from outside? It is very close by, \\xa0so they get it from outside from the shop in carts.', 'Do they buy tea from outside? See I will tell you. \\xa0The area which is around the community centre, where the Rajasthani people are there, who are those people of Gora Kumbhar, they won’t bring it from outside. They will make at home.', 'Do they buy tea from outside? Yes. They will make at home.', \"Do they buy tea from outside? But these Patni community or the Vaghri community won’t make the tea at home. When you go in the morning at 8 o'clock and stand there, you can see everybody with tea in that plastic bag. The entire traffic will be only that and all the cans will be fallen on the roads.\", 'Do they buy tea from outside? Also they have that Poori and Khari. Also Paav. Nowadays they have Samosas which are like Khari or puffs.', 'Yes, puffs. Yes, they have that.', 'Then what is the reason for that, for not cooking it and is getting it from outside? What is the reason? You tell.', \"Then what is the reason for that, for not cooking it and is getting it from outside? The reason is that, \\xa0for selling the vegetables they have to go out know. So they have to take bath and leave immediately. So in the morning around 6, 6.30 or around 5 o'clock, \\xa0they leave their children who are sleeping and go to bring their goods. Their children would be roaming around just like that in anganwadi. Then around 10 or 10.30, \\xa0they might fill their carts and go to the market. Their children may not even had any tea or anything.\", 'So it is because of the lack of time. The tea may be there in one vessel or glass and children will have it by themselves. Then children will come running over here saying “Teacher came, teacher came”. In my area it is like that only. We use to try to explain to them, \\xa0but their problems is also like that. So we cannot say anything much.', \"Then do they have the knowledge that, it is harmful to our body to have the oil, chilli and sugar in higher quantity and it will benefit us if we are leaving that? \\xa0Do they have that knowledge or don't they have that understanding at all? We are giving that understanding to them.\", \"Then do they have the knowledge that, it is harmful to our body to have the oil, chilli and sugar in higher quantity and it will benefit us if we are leaving that? \\xa0Do they have that knowledge or don't they have that understanding at all? They know it.\", \"Then do they have the knowledge that, it is harmful to our body to have the oil, chilli and sugar in higher quantity and it will benefit us if we are leaving that? \\xa0Do they have that knowledge or don't they have that understanding at all? We are giving them the understanding.\", \"But they don't want to obey it. They used to say like ” Bhabhie, all those things will be for you and nothing will happen to us”\", \"But they don't want to obey it. They use to say that ”Nothing will happen to us”. Suppose if there is an old lady who has come in the meeting and if we are explaining to that particular lady, then they would say that “I have eaten this only for the whole of my life, and here I am. What is the problem?”. They use to say like “We have eaten these things in our whole life and what new things you are telling now. So I have eaten like this only. \\xa0Am I not alive?”.\", 'Then will they leave when the doctors are advising them or still will it be the same? Nobody leaves.', 'Then will they leave when the doctors are advising them or still will it be the same? Yeah, they won’t leave.', 'Then will they leave when the doctors are advising them or still will it be the same? They promise like “Okay, we will do that”. But they don’t leave.', 'Then will they leave when the doctors are advising them or still will it be the same? When we did the checkups for diabetes, there was one old lady on Tekra and she had diabetes around 380.', 'Was it Mankhu Ben? I don’t remember the name. Her diabetes was around 380.', '380? Yes, when we did the checkups. Then we told her that she have diabetes. Then she said that “Yes, I know that I have diabetes”. Then we asked her “Do you know that you have so much of diabetes?” . So doctor has gave me the medicine. We have that Emelina as nurse volunteer. She was there and the doctor was from U.S. She said that “Yes, I know that. But I don’t want to take medicine”. Then we asked that “Why you don’t want to take?”. She said “I am fed up by taking the medicine”. Then Emily asked her that “Do you know that if you are not taking medicine, then you may die ?”. Then she said that “Yes, I know, but then what to do? I have to eat know”. If it is becoming too serious, so that they cannot walk or they are getting bed ridden, then if the doctor are saying them that “If you are not taking medicine, then you may die”. Then they may stop for a week or ten days. The moment they start to feel better and they are out from the bed, then everything is stopped. They stop medication as well. I have told know, it was diabetes of 380.', 'They don’t complete the course. For them there is no such concept of completing the course. What course? Suppose if you are having viral fever, then doctors will give you the medicine for 4 or 5 days know. That is the course know. And suppose when you take it for one day, in viral fever if you are taking the medicine for one day you might start feeling better.  So then they will stop. They would say like “Bhabhie, I had become alright. Then why I am taking medicine?”. So they have this kind of concept. It is all very different and which are outside of reach and understanding. And they give such a reply that we don’t even know what to tell them.', 'They don’t complete the course. Today only I had an argument with one lady. She goes to sell coconuts. I told her that “Your child is eating Pepsi and other outside things the whole day. He is roaming on the ground whole day without any slippers. And he didn’t come in anganwadi”. Then she says that “See we don’t keep our children in our house. Also we spend 60 to 70 rupees for them” . Then I told her that “But this is not home cooked food. You may gave Choco bar of 5 rupees or packet food of 10 rupees. He use to eat Sav Murmura. But not the home cooked food, right”. Then she answered that “We don’t mind in spending 60 or 70 rupees for our children. We are not like you”. This happened today.', 'So children eat everything from outside, right? They say it with very much pride, that my child is using 50 rupees per day. On Tekra, we try to tell them. But they say like “My child spends 50 rupees per day”. Then I ask him that “Okay, for 50 rupees what did he ate? Pepsi or those fryums. If you had given any nutritious food, then tell me. ” Then I ask them that “Did you get 2 packets of milk? Did you give him milk?”. They give tea to the children.', 'That means they have money, but it is used in the wrong place. Right now in our slums, there is no problem of money to have food. They have money. But with that, they don’t know “What to eat?”. Either they don’t know or they don’t want to know.', 'Alright. Then everyday while they are cooking, do they consider the thing that the food needs to be a wholesome or nutritious meal? Or is it like whatever they are seeing or having, they cook it? More than what they see, they considers about the taste of their tongue or what they like to eat. What they use to do is, they put too much of oil, chilli and salt. So the actual taste goes. So they almost burns the original taste. They cook everything spicy and put lot of oil. So for whatever their tongue has the taste, like potato, onion or garlic, those three they have maximum. It is not always like that. They use to take green vegetables as well, like spinach. But they make that also as spicy. So the original taste gets burned. They cook it so much, so that it may get stuck in the vessel. Like that they cook and eat so much. So then you won’t get the nutritious value out of that.', 'So they don’t want to put their mind into cooking? No, whatever is the taste of their tongue and whatever is convenient for cooking like they need it to be cooked in less time. Everything has to be tasty and that too with chilli and spices.', 'Then they would have chilli in their mind as well. Yes, they have chilli in their mind as well.', 'So I don’t have to ask you about leaving something. Okay, then there may patients of TB or having cholesterol, who might be advised to leave salt . Then do they leave? There are no cholesterol patients over here. So…', 'No cholesterol? No. Almost everybody here is working, know. Though they are having too much of oil, they are working as well. They work physically quite a lot. The main problem in the gents is addictions like tobacco or alcohol. Mostly it is because of these addictions they are becoming sick or are dying. If the gents are having some problem, then it is because of these addictions like Beedi, tobacco, Gutkha and alcohol. Majority of them die because of that and they have problems because of that. Cholesterol and diabetes cases are prevailing very less, to the minimal level.', 'Then how is their will power? Will power is very strong.', 'Then is there any possibility that they would decide like “I will not eat this thing from today onwards” or ”I will not drink”?  Is it possible or they will never decide like that? Will power is very strong as such. Because I feel that it is just because of that will power, they are managing their lives in such an adverse condition. That is what my observation is and they don’t complaint. Even if a lady is eating food in once a day, she will never complain that “I have problem and I am not getting food to eat”. Gents also will not complain. You will see them smiling. I think that is will power and a positive way. I would say more than will power, it is like hopelessness that “Despite of whatever I do, my life will go like this only”. Or they would say like “Bhabhie, this children are going to remain like this only”, “We will remain like this only” or “Nothing can be done”.', 'So they have given up the hope for betterment. They use to say like “What have the government done for us? Government also cannot do anything. Our life is like this only. Nobody has done anything for us”. So they have hopelessness as well, along with all the other things.', 'Are there any families who would follow and observe these things? Yes, there are some families like that.', 'They are there. Yes, but hardly any. What was the scenario at your place like whatever you say, they would listen. Do you have such families?', 'They are there. Yes, they are there. Many are there.', 'Okay, there are many. In Khadia and Merva community, whenever we explain to them they use to listen to us.', 'Not like that. I want to know about these food habits. Like suppose if you are going to their house to pick the kid and are seeing their meals with so much of oil and spices, then do you tell them that “You should not eat with this much of oil and spices”? Yes, we tell them', 'Then do they listen to what you are saying? Yeah, they tell us that “Tomorrow onwards we will not give them then”. But the children eats the same thing. They just tell us for the sake of telling. I will tell you about one incident that has happened in our anganwadi itself. One day that Rahula Ben came and she had made that vegetable pulav. Rahula Ben said that “It is very spicy”. When she checked it from the vessel, she said that “It is very spicy, nobody would eat”. Then Meena Ben said that “No, you see they would eat” and children ate it. People found it very spicy, but still they ate, extra as well. And where the chilli was less, so much kichdi was left behind.', 'Then do they listen to what you are saying? Many times I had seen they doing “ Haa, haa ” because of spiciness. But they use to do that and kept eating as well.', 'Oh, is it so? There would be tear coming out from their eyes and water coming from their nose, and they would make those sounds and still they would eat. Even I use to say like “There is so much of oil and it is red because of so much chilli. What have you done?”. But they would say like “No, the children eat like this only”. Then I tell them that “You don’t have to cook as per their pattern. At least you try to cook in a different way”. Then they would say that “Bhabhie, children would not eat that.” The children in slums eat only less sweets.', 'So they eat only less of sweets. Yes, they want spicy food.', 'So they eat only less of sweets. They don’t like sweets. Our sweet snacks are used less.', 'So they eat only less of sweets. Yes, they need spicy snacks.', 'Then why they are not able to leave so much of chilli. Is it very difficult or is there any reason for that? As you are working here for so many years did you see any reason? It is only because of the thing that they have eaten like that right from the beginning. So they have got that habit.', 'Is that the only reason? There is no other reason? What can be the other reason?', 'Is that the only reason? There is no other reason? Mainly it is because that the whole culture has been developed like that. Eating spicy is their culture, like how there is a culture in majority of Gujarati people to eat sweets. Like we need sweets in almost everything, because in my house we put sugar or jaggery in almost everything like in vegetable or the other things. Also after eating we wanted to have something sweet. There is a pattern like that. In the same way this Rajasthan and U.P will be having their pattern. And in the same way it has become a culture for these people to eat food with a lot of chilli. So we have to remove it from one entire generation and that needs lot of time. Also if you see what is the incentive for them, it is only food. And in that it is the taste. Which are the other things in their lives right from the morning to the evening, which gives them happiness ? It is mostly the spicy food and whatever addiction they are having. So we can consider this habit of eating spicy food as one of the addiction itself. So it has been intricated in their culture.', 'Alright. They have certain eating habits like this tea culture. So that has become like a culture for them.', 'Okay, I want to ask about tea that, they make very sweet tea right? Then do you have any example in your mind where they are making  tea without sugar? No.', 'As per you, do you have the feeling that they might leave sugar when there is a requirement for that? No, they cannot leave.', 'Then how about tea? Can they leave tea? No, they need tea mandatorily.', 'Then how about tea? Can they leave tea? For the tea it is like, even if they don’t have food it is okay for them. But they need the tea mandatorily. Their attitude is such that, whether we live or die, they need tea for sure. They have this attitude. They don’t care about the thing that they might not be able to live long or not. They know that “We would die at an early age, if we are drinking alcohol”. But they are not able to leave that. In a way their will power is very strong, but not in this matter. In a way their will power is very strong, because right from the morning they use to stand in the que for water, they use to do a lot of hard work.', 'No, I am asking regarding this matter. I am asking leaving addictions, alcohol or any other harmful things that they are eating. Do they have the will power to leave that? No.', 'No ? Nobody might have even tried? There would be some exceptional cases know, like somebody is a patient or sick, to whom the doctor has advised and they have left it. Then they might have come to you saying that “Doctor has told us to leave this, so we left it. But we don’t like this kind of food ”. Is there any such cases? Because you use to talk to them on every day, know. If somebody is sick then doctor would tell them that “You are not supposed to eat this. Don’t eat at least for one week ”. then they might have stopped eating also and that person might have come to you to tell that “Doctor told me leave sugar. But I don’t like to have tea without sugar” or like “I am feeling the food as bland without any oil”. They use to try for hardly for 4 days or something like that.', 'No ? Nobody might have even tried? There would be some exceptional cases know, like somebody is a patient or sick, to whom the doctor has advised and they have left it. Then they might have come to you saying that “Doctor has told us to leave this, so we left it. But we don’t like this kind of food ”. Is there any such cases?

Don’t eat at least for one week ”. then they might have stopped eating also and that person might have come to you to tell that “Doctor told me leave sugar. But I don’t like to have tea without sugar” or like “I am feeling the food as bland without any oil”. Yeah, they tell us that “We cannot manage without sugar.”', 'So they feel the food as bland. They don’t feel interest in eating that food and don’t have satisfaction in eating. Another thing is that they will not lie in front of us. They won’t say like “They didn’t eat”. They tell whatever they had done. At least to these people they would tell the truth. For example, there is a Mahesh Bhai who is the watchman in Paryavaran Mitra.', 'Yes, Mahesh Bhai. He is an example in front of us that he use to drink a lot of alcohol and we had send him to the rehabilitation center through Manav Sadhna. Then he had left alcohol. So today his life has completely changed. That was one inspiration for us that he had decided and he is able to do like that. The will power of Mahesh Bhai is strong as well and he is doing so much of work single handedly. He has used his will power to leave his addiction. So he is doing good.', 'Do these people know about diabetes, like what is diabetes? They might not be having too much of true knowledge about what diabetes is. They will be knowing this much for sure, that in diabetes one should not eat sweet.', 'Do these people know about diabetes, like what is diabetes? Yes, they know that much.', 'Do these people know about diabetes, like what is diabetes? Sugar should not be eaten or tea should be without sugar, that much they know. But only very less people, almost like minimal, know about what is diabetes, what causes diabetes and if we are not taking care what would happen because of that. Almost people don’t have these type of information. Almost they don’t know like what exactly diabetes is and why does it happen.', 'That means they only know one thing, that is sugar. Yeah, they know that they should not eat sweets. Isn’t it? That is the only concept they are having.', 'Are there any other make beliefs going on? Do you have any idea? Also they use to say that if a person is having diabetes, then they should not have potato.', 'Are there any other make beliefs going on? Do you have any idea? Yes, potato.', 'Are there any other make beliefs going on? Do you have any idea? Yeah, should not have the sugar in potato.', 'Do they know about which parts of the body it harms? Do they have that kind of knowledge? Yes, they use to tell that if we are getting hurt then the dent will be there.', 'Do they know about which parts of the body it harms? Do they have that kind of knowledge? Yes, it gets infected or septic. That’s it. They know only that much.', 'Do they know about which are the other things that may be caused due to diabetes or which are the other illnesses caused due to this particular illness? Do they have any idea about that? No, they don’t know about it.', 'Do they know about which are the other things that may be caused due to diabetes or which are the other illnesses caused due to this particular illness? Do they have any idea about that? No, they don’t know.', 'Do they eat non- veg? Majority of the people in the community eat non- veg.', 'Okay, majority of them eat non-veg. Yes, they have this pattern of eating non-veg and also eggs.', 'If you are seeing the entire area, how much of people might be having diabetes? How much must be the spread of diabetes over here? Is it widespread or is it less? It is less, because not so many people are affected.', 'If you are seeing the entire area, how much of people might be having diabetes? How much must be the spread of diabetes over here? Is it widespread or is it less? I can say only that much that it is less. But I am not able to tell you the percentage like how much percent it will be. It is very less. For community center in Tekra, I can tell you that it is very less. See we did the checkups know. We had done the diagnosis camps and so it is very less.', 'Approximately how much must be the population of  the entire Tekra? The population of Tekra might be around 60000.', '60000? Yes, it might be between 60000 to 70000.', '60000 to 70000? Between 60000 to 70000? Yes, around 60000. May be not more than that.', 'How you got this number into your mind? Have you done any research? It is through anganwadi.', 'Okay, is it through anganwadi? Yes, see we have about 46 anganwadis. Now for that 46, if we are seeing the community centers and the population around it, I am including Chadrabhaga also in this, also Purpidit, then not more than 60000.', 'There are 79 anganwadis, know. Not 46. Other anganwadis are in other areas know. See, 46 anganwadis are there in Juna Vadaj, that is the old Vadaj. Tekro is a very big area in Juna Vadaj. There are other slums also. So if you start Tekro from here till the end, then the population here is around 60000. Not more than that. And there are 33 centers of Sabarmati.', 'Okay. Do they know that whether diabetes can be cured or not? Will it get cured or no? They know this much that if we are not eating certain things then it will get reduced.', 'Okay. Do they know that whether diabetes can be cured or not? Will it get cured or no? Okay, they know that they should walk. They have that knowledge that if a person is having diabetes, then they need to walk a lot.', 'So they feel that it can be cured or something like that. Yes, they have this feeling that if we take medicine, then it will get cured. See that lady, she had stopped taking medicines know. I don’t know why. The lady who had diabetes of 380. Then if the person is getting into too much trouble, then they will take it by themselves. They use to keep medicine with them and would tell that “Sister, I have the medicine with me”, like a joke as if how a person with headache is keeping and having the medicine.', 'They are becoming doctors by themselves. Yes, they are becoming doctors for themselves.', 'Do these people do exercises or not? No.', 'Do these people do exercises or not? Oh god, it is zero.', 'Do these people do exercises or not? Their work is their exercise, they are doing so much of labor work that they don’t need to the exercises.', 'Do these people do exercises or not? Yes, they use to do so much of labor, then where is the need to do the exercise.', 'But if you are seeing the work, then it is a physical labor. But how about Yoga and Pranayam? No, they don’t do anything.', 'Okay, they don’t do anything. Then do they know that doing exercises is beneficiary to them? For Prana-Yam know, they would take our Prana. I am just kidding.', 'So they know that it is good for the body. They know that it is good for their health and we make them do as well. Didn’t we do it for Jyotsna? She would come and would do it for as many days where the camp was there. After that she would say like “Sister, every day we are doing exercise only know”.', 'Is that the reason for not doing it, that they are doing physical exercise every day or do they have some other excuses as well? Also they don’t have time. That’s is what they use to say.', 'Is that the reason for not doing it, that they are doing physical exercise every day or do they have some other excuses as well? Yes, they don’t have time and that is true.', 'So there is lack of time. Also if we think, there is one more thing and it is the place. In such a small place they are staying with their in laws and as 7 to 8 people together. Where will they do the exercise? Where will they go to do exercise?', 'Suppose if you are telling them to do exercise, like if you are saying like “We should do for 30 minutes per day”, then will they listen? It is not at all like that, like to whatever we say, they would listen to everything.', 'Suppose if you are telling them to do exercise, like if you are saying like “We should do for 30 minutes per day”, then will they listen? Yes, they will agree and would say that “Sister, okay I will do”.', 'Suppose if you are telling them to do exercise, like if you are saying like “We should do for 30 minutes per day”, then will they listen? See, the thing is like first of all I cannot talk about exercises in front of the ladies just like that. When can I talk to them? Suppose if I am starting with my anganwadi ladies, like when we are doing their workshops for the 2 to 3 days very nicely, we use to give talks and explain to them. At last we say them that “After 2 to 3 days you feel know that how much important it is to do exercise, Pranayam or Yoga. Our life will be longer. We will be happy in our lives”. Like these we explain to them everything. So like that first we have to motivate them. I cannot call them and tell them in a meeting that “Okay, from tomorrow you should start doing exercise and Yoga”. We cannot do that. Also if we are thinking deeper, right now we have to work for their basic health and hygiene and this concept of doing exercise is not there in their mind right now. So if we are talking about the concept which is not there in their mind at all, there won’t be any positive changes. So I don’t even tell them. I definitely use to tell our teachers that “You should do exercise or you should do Yoga”.', 'Then what is the problem for you all? We also have the problem of time. We also don’t get time, nothing else.', 'Does everyone in a house have an account in the bank? Yes.', 'Does everyone in a house have an account in the bank? Yes. Under the Jan Dhan scheme mostly everybody has opened their account.', 'Does everyone in a house have an account in the bank? Mostly everybody is having an account.', 'How many account would be there per house? Minimum one would be there.', 'Then how about insurance? Very less.', 'Then how about insurance? Some communities, like the community which are residing at the front side of Tekra and not at the backside, not at the area of Vadiyari Vas but at the front area where there are quarters build, they are financially balanced. Those people have insurance. Also the people in the area of \\xa0Dhangdhara have insurance. These people have posts and they use to invest high in those post office accounts. In post office, there use to have 200 rupees or 500 rupees schemes, know. They invest highest in that. Also there are local saving groups and they have lot of trust in that. But in that lot of people use to cheat these poor people. You had one such incident from those savings groups, right? That somebody has come to your place in the name of creating a new saving group… (to lady3).', 'Then how about insurance? They asked all ladies for their passbook, asked for xeroxes and photographs. And they wanted to give training for about 2 days. All the ladies from Vatavaran had come. Also they asked to go to anganwadi as well.', 'Then how about insurance? When was this? At least you could have asked me.', 'Then how about insurance? This was before the vacation. It was before the May vacation on our Vatsalya day.', 'Then how about insurance? At least you should ask us before calling them.', 'Then how about insurance? No, they had said like they had done these kind of lot of work for this. But Neeta Ben, I didn’t help them.', 'Then how about insurance? Please don’t become a cause for that, because if that person is doing some scandal, then your name will also get involved.', 'Then how about insurance? He came and told me that “I know Neeta Ben and you tell and call every ladies”. So all the ladies came and he told a time on 22nd and he left. Then he came on 24th. So nobody sat there.', 'Then how about insurance? Good, whatever happened was good.', 'Then how about insurance? He said that “I know Neeta Ben. I know Aditya Patel”. He said that and came to anganwadi.', 'You have said that you have to motivate everybody. How you have been motivating them till now? Which are the different strategies that you have used? Using different strategies means, in that to motivate them to maximum, we have to tell them like that “If you are not sending your children to school or if you are giving this type of food to your children, then these are the harm and disadvantages that will happen to your children”. We also tell them that “You have stayed in the slum for your whole life. Then do you want your children also stay and live in the same way? Then their life will also go in the same way itself.”', 'So you use fear. Yes, we have to make them afraid like that. Unless they are having the fear like “If we are not doing this, that will happen”, like for example when we say like “If you are having many children one after the other, then there are chances for you having cancer” and if they are feeling little afraid about that, then only they will be ready to change slowly. This also may not happen at once and so I have to keep them telling many times.', 'But your work is done by only talking and explaining. There is no need to do anything else? Mostly we can talk only know. We keep explaining to them again and again. Some times these people might blackmail them emotionally too. Suppose if a lady is having 4 to 5 kids then we tell her that “You are already having 4 to 5 kids and if you are not doing the family planning operation, when you are dying, gents will get another lady to live with. Then what will happen to your children?”. So they use to explain to them like this. So we have to work on the emotional aspect as well. We also give them motivation.', 'No, for example, it may not be required here, when I am going to somewhere to do a survey to somebody’s place we take something with us, as a small gift for them. Or when there is a problem of food, then we will take food for them when going to their place. If that person is having any monetary problem, then we will take money with us when going to that person’s place. Or else if we are going to meet somebody who is in the hospital, then we take fruits with us while going. So do you do something like that? No.', 'No, for example, it may not be required here, when I am going to somewhere to do a survey to somebody’s place we take something with us, as a small gift for them. Or when there is a problem of food, then we will take food for them when going to their place. If that person is having any monetary problem, then we will take money with us when going to that person’s place. Or else if we are going to meet somebody who is in the hospital, then we take fruits with us while going. So do you do something like that? We never give them motivation with gift, money or anything like that . Our motivation is like suppose if there is any emergency in the family, like if the child is seriously sick, then we will tell that “Don’t worry about money. Manav Sadhna will take care of the treatment of the child. The sister in the anganwadi will help you”. But we never give money or any other gifts in their hand, because that is entirely a wrong concept. That is like we are making them greedy. Then we would never know if others are trying to take wrong advantage from that. They would try to blackmail you emotionally. If you are giving it to one person, you have to be answerable. You have an accountability in the community. They would come and ask you that “You had given it to that person and why not to me?”. Then you should have an answer. If you can’t reply, then you will lose their trust. You cannot do like helping one person and not helping other person. You can’t do like that. You have to be answerable for everything that you are doing in the community. Community will ask you questions like “You had given dress to that lady”, “You had given food or packet to that lady” and “Why not me?” or “You are giving snacks to this person and why not me?”. All lady will come and would ask you like “ You are giving food to their children, why not me?”. Then you have to explain to them. So you are accountable for that and the answer needs to be given.', 'Do they make issue out of these things? Yes, they make issue out of small things. These people have to face a lot (by denoting other teachers).', 'What type of issues do they make? Even if there is a small box or a pencil, then itself they make an issue by asking like “You have given it to that person, why you have not given it to me? Our child is also coming to the anganwadi know.”', 'Is it so? Suppose somebody has come to give something in the anganwadi and if a child is absent, then next day they would come and ask “Why? Was my name not present here? Why we were not given?”', 'Is it so? They come next day asking for it. We had a wheat distribution programme. In that as well just for 2 kilos of wheat, one man kept saying that “I have lot of influence. I will go and talk to Ananthi Ben”. They forget about all other things at that time.', 'Is it so? You have to give reply to them. You are answerable. Suppose if you are saying that “It is my wish and I would give to that person”, then it is finished. They will never listen to you. They will not give respect after that. They will not even trust you. Then you have to explain to them. They eat heads of these poor people (by showing the other teachers). How many times we would explain that “This person is the beneficiary and we would give to that person” or “Our intention is nutrition and this person is the beneficiary, so we need to give it to him till 6 years and if your kid hasn’t come to anganwadi, then he will not get. This snack is for the kids who are regularly coming to the anganwadi. Name is registered, but has your child come? If not, then he will not get. In that day when the child is present here, then he will get. So for that you need to come to anganwadi and anganwadi will not come to your house“. So these are there in that.', 'In the camps you are conducting, do the people come willingly or do you have to do work for that also? That depends. I feel that it depends on what type of work the camp people are doing. If they are doing good work, then everybody will come.', 'So what type of work you people use to do, when the camps are conducted? If we are going and calling them, then they will come. We have to go and call them or have to remind them that “Tomorrow there is the camp”, then they will come. We have to go and meet up on the previous day to say that “Tomorrow there is the camp and you need to be present there”, then they will come.', 'So what type of work you people use to do, when the camps are conducted? In that as well it depends on how is your connection with the community. That makes the difference. Many times I had seen like even if a sister is going to tell them for 10 times, they won’t come. Also it may happen like even you are going to tell them only once, they would come. It depends on your connection with the community or how much is your respect in the community. Many times it has happened like even if the sister is going there only once, everybody use to come. Also many times even if the other sister is going 10 times, they will not come. So it depends on how is the performance of that sister in the community. It depends completely on that.', 'Okay, it depends on that. See, all the communities are not same. You have to work hard and make place in their heart. You have to create trust and respect for yourself in their heart and it takes time.', 'Then how do you follow up about these things? Follow up of what?', 'You might be telling a lot of things to the people that “You should do this” or “You should not do this” or you might be telling the children that “You do this“. We use to do home visit for them.', 'Nothing else? How many home visits do you do? How many houses comes under one center? 200 houses. But everyone is not a beneficiary.', 'Nothing else? How many home visits do you do? How many houses comes under one center? There are 200 to 250 houses or families.  Then it is not necessary that in all the families there might be children or a pregnant lady. Out of the 200, there might be 100 or 50 or 70 like that, where our actual beneficiaries are there. So we have to visit only those houses wherever our target beneficiaries are there.', 'Not for anybody else? No, but then what happens is that the ladies use to have trust on anganwadi. They are connected and they have relationship. Then they come on their own and use to share with us. They use to meet us on the road, while coming or going. Even if they are not our beneficiaries they use to talk to us like “This is what happened” and all. Suppose if some lady or an old man are staying alone or somebody is having TB and their financial condition is not good, then these sisters would give them nutrition as well, even if they are not our beneficiaries. If somebody is knowing about such things, then they would come and suggest to the sisters that “Sister, the condition of that person is not good, please take care of them. Please give him something“. So you can think this way that anganwadi is a hub for the community, since these people are working here for so many years, they know that for what all things they can approach anganwadi or what they can tell in anganwadi.', 'So they don’t need to be given any other way of encouragement now. Mostly there is no need, since they know.', 'So it is working  with connection only. Yes, they have connection. Suppose you want to introduce a new subject, then you have to bring in a new concept and a new time. You have to bring in all those things. But whatever work we are doing right now, is not having nothing like that. Like we have to tell them for 500 times. If there is a meeting they will come. Isn’t it? (asking to other teachers)', 'So it is working  with connection only. Yes, if there is a meeting they will come.', 'So if there is a meeting, will they come? Whether they want to listen or not, it is their wish. But if there is a meeting they will come for sure.', 'Okay, they come. If there is a camp, they will come on their own by asking “When we are going to get the vaccination?”', 'What kind of body structure everybody has? Are people fat or thin or they have body of proper measurement? They don’t have same kind of body. Some are fat, some are thin. But there are not more on fatter side.', 'What kind of body structure everybody has? Are people fat or thin or they have body of proper measurement? There are very few fat people.', 'Okay, very less fat people! See I will tell you. From all the ladies, about 50 percent of them would be anemic.', 'Are they anemic? Yes, 50 percent... 40 to 50  percent ladies are anemic. That I can tell you for sure. Girls are anemic as well. Almost same  percent. 40 to 50  percent. You will see thin girls. Even ladies are also thin like that.', 'What is the reason? For Anemia? It is because of their eating habits. Mainly it is because of their eating habits, also because of their culture like they would give foods first to gents or boys. Also they have concepts that girls don’t need to have a fat body as they are not going out for works. They don’t need to be fat or like that.', 'Do they have that mentality? Yes. They use to say that girls has to be like this only or ladies body has to be like this only. Even if a woman is thin and lean, they will not feel anything wrong in that.', 'That means, 50 percent are thin and how about the rest 50 percent? Little bit better like how these sisters are. (Showing the ladies sitting there) They would be like that.', 'That means, 50 percent are thin and how about the rest 50 percent? It could be like that also, that bodily they would be having a heavy body but there will not be enough blood in that. Such ladies also are there, she will be having a heavy body but there won’t be enough blood in her body.', 'Yeah, like she only looks fat but there is no strength in her body. Such peoples might be very less know. How many might be there? Very few would be like that.', 'Yeah, like she only looks fat but there is no strength in her body. Such peoples might be very less know. How many might be there? In our area, in the case of a pregnant women, we need not search for her.  She would come by her own to register her name, by saying “Please register my name”.', 'How about gents? How are they? Fat ,thin or measured body, proper body? Medium.', 'Are all medium or mostly medium ? In gents, either they would be thin or medium.', 'How about boys? Are boys also the same way? Yeah, it is not necessary that everybody is a body builder. But compared to girls, malnutrition is less in boys.', 'Do ladies have addictions? Or is it only in gents? Yes they have.', 'What are the things of which they have addiction? Tobacco and Mirage.', 'What are the things of which they have addiction? Tobacco, Mirage and in Sabarmati area, they drink alcohol as well.', 'What are the things of which they have addiction? They are certain areas were ladies drink alcohol. For example Nadavas, all ladies in Nadavas drink alcohol.', 'What are the things of which they have addiction? Not all ladies.', 'Which community is that? They use to say like “Sister, we want to drink”. There is a community called Kadiya Berva, where if there is a marriage, then on the previous night, when all gents go to sleep, all ladies will do this only. They drink alcohol and play a lots of mischiefs. They use to say like “It has to be like this only, we must drink”.', 'Which community is that? Kadiya Berva', 'Which community is that? Kadiya Berva… Not Kadiya Berva.', 'Which community is that? Here there is Chara Nagar know..', 'Chada!! Not Chada, it is Chara. It is the Chara community which has become infamous for stealing. It is the community which does stealing and all. They are Chara People.', 'Alright They do crime like small or big stealing. Also they do the business of making desi liquor. Those wood liquors are from Chara community people. That is a quite dangerous community.', 'Don’t you get scared? We became used to them.', 'Oh, you got used to them. But I have seen that, they don’t do any kind of trouble with Anganwadi sisters.', 'Till today nobody has any problem? We have many Anganwadi like that. Like here there would be an Anganwadi and next to that there would be an alcohol shop.', 'Yes, I saw that, it is here nearby only. It is here on the opposite itself.', 'Yes, I saw that, it is here nearby only. Here at the corner of the road it is. Here, there is the alcohol shop and we have to walk and go through that way.', 'I heard that. When I were talking to one of the teacher, she told me that gents would drink alcohol and would come to her and tell that “Sister, if you need any help please tell”. Yes, they say like that.', 'Even if he is drunk? Yeah, they says, “Sister if somebody troubles you, inform me”.', 'Even if he is drunk? It is at Biku Ben’s place.', 'Even if he is drunk? We don’t even look at them. Like if we are going to this Rupa Ben’s house, they will not even look at us as well.', 'Suppose if you are passing by then they may go to a side, right? Either they would go to a side or they will look down and sit, because they know that we won’t trouble them. Why should we take their names? If they trouble us, then we will also raise the concern saying that these people are troubling us. Then the police also has to get involved as this would be a government case. Then police has to take some action. So they know that they might fall into trouble. But I don’t remember any incidents like that in my sixteen years of experience. It has never happened, that some drunken person has troubled any lady or any sisters or teased them or any sister has complained to me.', 'Okay, so they drink alcohol but it is not troubling anybody, neither you nor anybody from the community. It does not trouble anybody, but it causes problem in their house.', 'Okay, so they drink alcohol but it is not troubling anybody, neither you nor anybody from the community. Recently it has happened here at 4 number, at Sheetal Ben’s place, that a boy use to sit outside the door of my Anganwadi with alcohol.', 'Was that boy small? He was a young boy of 15 to16 years old. I told him that if you are choosing somewhere else, then it is okay, but not at my Anganwadi. Then he said, “I am not getting any other place. This is the only place”. Then I told him “Brother, you have to find another place. Otherwise you will not get any place”. Even though we had spoken to him, despite of that he was sitting there. Then we had spoken to the leader of the community. We have told them that “We had never come in your ways till now. But we cannot accept somebody sitting outside my Anganwadi”, since it was like here he is sitting and just near to that is my Anganwadi door. That cannot be allowed, know.', 'No, that is not right. Because then my children would see him while coming and going, and all the gents would come outside to buy the alcohol. Then my teachers also would feel it very awkward. They will have to keep the doors closed. So I told that “This cannot be allowed”. We had done little bit of arguments and then slowly we made him understand. We had given him some warning also, that “If you are sitting here, then I will have to call police”. After that he went away. After that he is not sitting. Now he sits behind the Anganwadi. And then people drink and put the bottles in the Anganwadi.', 'Then after drinking, do clashes take place? In the community, there are clashes. But mostly that use to happen at night.', 'It happens at night. Is it so that they beat the ladies from the house only and they don’t dare to do it outside ? They show their daring outside as well. But it use to happen at night.', 'It happens at night. Is it so that they beat the ladies from the house only and they don’t dare to do it outside ? They do this fights after drinking alcohol. But once they become alright, they use to stand again together. They would be again together.', 'Okay, is it like that ? They are together again. Yes', 'Okay, is it like that ? They are together again. After drinking alcohol, they use to have clashes during day time as well. But it has nothing to do with us. They use to have their internal fights, like with the neighbor or with the money lender. So if somebody is taking a name or pinpoint someone, then it becomes a trouble as they are drunk.', 'So they keep it in their mind. I don’t think so.', 'Or is it not like that ? When they are drunk, they do all these fights. But once they become alright, there would be nothing in their mind.', 'Or is it not like that ? There won’t be anything.

People from the entire Rampir Tekra come and also if there are any patients from their villages they would bring them as well.', 'Do they bring them also?  This Tekra is so big, right. (Lady with tea is asking where a particular thing is kept. Dr. Poonam replies her that it could be there) Approximately how much might be the population of Tekra? Approximately more than 20000.', 'More than 20000!! Alright. Do people come from places around your clinic or even from the faraway places? No people comes from far places also.', 'Even from far places? Yeah, because we charge only the token price which is Rs.3', 'Rs.3? Yes.', 'Nothing else? There will be charges for per day medicine. But per day medicine charge is also Rs.3. If they go to any other place is it will cost them from 30 to 40 rupees.', 'Yeah, it becomes 30 to 40 rupees. Morning time is not convenient for them because most of them are rag pickers, shoe polishers and drive pedal rickshaw. So, they leave either in the morning or in the mid night. They collect rags and sort them all and they sell it. Their daily life runs on whatever money they are getting from this. So, there are no patients in the morning. We had started in the morning once, but because of this problem no patients were coming. Because if he doesn’t go what will he eat? Did you understand?', 'Yes, I understood. So it is suitable for them in the evening.', 'Okay. So, it is suitable for them in the evening only, because in the afternoon they can do all these work and then they are free in the evening after that.', 'What are your timings in Sanjeevani? I have been going to Sanjeevani for last 20 years from night 9’ clock to morning 9’ clock.', 'Okay. Night 9 to morning 9. If there are any serious problems, then they come to home also. So, if they are having any problems in the night, then they come to Sanjeevani hospital.', 'Alright. Yes. There are no charges. If I am there then it will be done for free.', 'Okay. That’s right. Don’t hospital people tell you anything, if you do it for free? No, it is in my charge. I am the in charge, so nobody says anything. They know what kind of service we are doing. So, there are no such things.', 'Then what types of patients comes to Sanjeevani? In Sanjeevani, all types of patients. Paralysis patients, patients having liver disease due to alcohol, BP, diabetes.', 'Do they all come only from Tekra? No. They all come from outside.', 'From outside? Tekra people don’t come there.', 'Tekra people don’t come to Sanjeevani? Hardly 5 to 10 percent. Because they cannot afford. Suppose they have to get hospitalized then we have to take them to government hospitals.', 'Which is the government hospital? Civil hospital is there, VS hospital is there. So, we take them to hospitals which are under corporation and government hospitals. (Lady brings mangoes for them and says that it is under riped) It is okay, he will eat. (To the lady)', 'What is the difference in diseases between patients who comes to Sanjeevani and who comes to Tekra? There is no difference as such. Same sickness only is there.', 'Same sickness is there? Yes. Same sickness.', 'No not like that. Couldn’t there be more patients with one particular kind of sickness more in Tekra and you don’t see such sickness in patients who comes to Sanjeevani? Skin disease patients and asthma patients are more on Tekra. You don’t see those kinds of patients outside. These people have skin diseases or eczema, because these people don’t have much awareness on cleanliness. So, they have more of skin diseases.', 'What type of skin diseases do they have? Skin diseases they have urticaria, psoriasis, rashes…', 'Do they have psoriasis also? Yes. They get psoriasis. Even they get herpes.', 'Do they get herpes also? Yes. They get herpes also.', 'They get medicines for that from here only? Yes, they get. Suppose if anyone is in need of any expensive medicine, then Manav Sadhna helps them. If any additional checkup is required, then also Manav Sadhna helps them for 50%.', 'Okay, it helps. Then these people who go for picking garbage, they remain in the dirt full time. Yes.', 'Is that the reason for any of the diseases? That’s the main reason for their skin diseases.', 'Alright. They get fever, they get diarrhea.', 'Alright. In Sanjeevani we can see paralysis and those other sicknesses? Yes. Uncontrolled diabetes, paralysis, hyper tension. There are patients with hemorrhage, severe stroke, asthmatic patients are there, COPD patients are there.', 'Then what about here in the clinic which you are running ? Meningitis is there.', 'Is there meningitis patients also? All type of diseases are there.', 'Okay, you have all types of patients. Do these patients come from Nava Vadaj, Akbar Nagar. Do they come from those areas? Ranip. Mostly from Ranip, Nava Vadaj, Ravipura, Navrang Pura. They come from all these places.', 'Alright. Recently I have cured one herpes case over here . There was one boy. (then doctor shows some pictures) See these pictures.', 'Oh!! Oh my god!! He got cured.', 'Has he cured? Yes.', 'Herpes is a STD, right? It is a virus.', 'Okay is it virus. Yes.', 'Alright. Herpes is a virus.', 'You said on this Tekra, you charge 3 rupees. Yes.', 'Then with that do you give medicines also for free? Yes. In 3 rupees one day medicine is given.', 'In 3 rupees? Suppose somebody have to do some dressing or injections then all that is done in 3 rupees.', '3 rupees? Then from where do you get all those funds? From Manav Sadhna? Yes. It comes from Manav Sadhna. And everything works on donations.', 'Alright. Do you give medicines on day-to-day basis? Yes. Suppose somebody needs more, like, in case of skin diseases, he doesn’t have to consult every day. Then for them we give as for two, three, four or five days. Suppose a person has asthma, then he need not have to come every day and he has to take medicines regularly. For him we give for four or five days at a time.', 'Alright. But then, do they take these medicines? Yes. They come regularly.', 'I mean you have given them medicines, then will they take it regularly? Yes. They have to take. Because they know that they can control their sickness with only medicines. So, we explain to them that they have to take. TB is more prevailing here. So, we have started a DOT center of corporation here. That DOT center is running for almost last 15 years. In that also usually there will be 50 patients.', 'For TB also? Yes. For TB also.', 'Alright. What is the reason for the spread of TB? TB spreads because of the atmosphere. Suppose somebody in the house has got TB and he is AB+, then see now he is infected. So there are chances for other people in the house to get TB. So, we have to give them awareness. So, we recently did a camp for TB. We did an awareness camp. We keep doing these things regularly. We showed them a movie also which shows how to stay in the house, how to tackle it, don’t spit anywhere, have good food.', 'Do they listen to all your advices? Yes.', 'There are so many things to do, right. Like take care of eating, do this and do that. If we keep them telling the same thing again and again, then there will be some advantage, some benefits.', 'Alright. There will be improvement. Yes. When I started, in the first year itself, for malaria 20,000 tablets were finished.', 'Okay. 20,000 tablets!! Yes. 15 years back. And today the situation is that, in one year even 1000 tablets are not getting finished. Still some are left from that. We used to do awareness for malaria, going to people’s house before and say what are the things to be done as precautionary measures. As precautionary measure we use to give them medicines for malaria in advance, on weekly basis. Our workers used to go door to door. Now malaria is not there at all.', 'It’s not there? No. It’s not there at all and before 20 years the picture of Rampir ka Tekra was very different and today it is different. Before they defecated wherever they want, there were water clogged at many places, curls would be there everywhere. Now toilets are built in everyone’s house, so that filth is not there anymore. So naturally diseases also will reduce.', 'That’s true. See now, when you give medicines many times what happens is, in my case if I have sickness and if I go to doctor he will give me medicines for 15 days. But I will be alright in 5 or 6 days. Then I stop taking medicines. Do such things happen over here? Yes, it happens over here also. But suppose someone has diarrhea. Then we explain to him right from the beginning that diarrhea will get cured eventually, but you have to complete the course of the medicine. So out of 10, 8 patients take it regularly. So, 80% will be regular in taking medicines. So, in that it will be not much of a problem.', 'Alright. What is the age group of most of your patients? Most patients are from aged and kids group.', 'Alright. Before, there were alcohol problems. Too much of alcohol problems was there in each and every house. Now it’s not there.', 'It’s not there now? No. It has been reduced to quite an extent.', 'Okay. Has it reduced? Yes, it has reduced. Before, in every house, every man used to drink alcohol.', 'No ladies? No, not ladies. They used to drive pedal rickshaws, then they get tired and then they says “Come lets drink alcohol”. Then it became a habit and then all the money goes into that only. But once their kids started coming to Manav Sadhna, that made a lot of difference in their lives.', 'Alright. So Manav Sadhna people used to go door to door and explain to them? Yes. They used to spread awareness on how harmful alcohol is and how much problem it gives. And this program started to go on regularly.', 'Do people come in camps? Yes, they come.', 'They come? Yes.', 'I heard a lot about alcohol, when we were roaming around this Tekra. This is nothing compared to what it was 10 to 12 years back. This is almost you can say as 25% of that. Before it was too much.', 'Alright. Then how is diabetes prevailing over here? Diabetes is there, but they get it done from the private hospitals. They do regular checkups for diabetes. Also, there are 10 to 15 patients of diabetes in our place as well. They regularly do the test in every month, with an empty stomach and in two hours after having food. They are regular in that.', 'That means only those people who have diabetes are regular? Yes.', 'Do you check each and every person for diabetes or you don’t check for each and every person? We check. We get it checked in laboratory as well. In laboratory also, they have to pay only 50 percent, because remaining 50 percent is helped by Manav Sadhna. So, the test for diabetes cost only 50 rupees. So, if you do a test for diabetes, then you only have to pay 50 percent and the rest 50 percent of the money is helped by Manav Sadhna. So, their work is done in half the money and therefore they do it regularly.', 'Alright. Because, recently when we were talking to some ladies over there, they said that there are so many ladies who are actually scared of doing the test, as they are worried that the test may say that they have diabetes and then they have to be cautious, have to do this and have to do that, take medicines throughout their life. So, because of that they were not even going for the test. They don’t want to do because there is no awareness. That person doesn’t know how harmful it can be. If a person knows that he has got diabetes and if we explain to him, then he comes regularly. See if that person comes in our contact, then he becomes regular.', 'Alright. So, you mean that the work is done once you explain it to them. Yes.', 'Alright. It may not be working for 100 percent, but 80 percent of it is done for sure.', 'Is it possible to do diabetes test in our clinic? Yes, we do it with glucometer.', 'So, with glucometer you do the test. How many glucometers do you have? Only one is there.', 'Only one is there? We don’t need to have many glucometers.', 'When do you do the tests? Supposed somebody has such complaints and if we get a doubt that he is having diabetes, then we test them.', 'Anytime? Yes. Anytime. And those who are regular here, won’t go to lab. Then they do test with us. Those who know that they are having diabetes and if they are not going out, then they come to us and do the tests with us.', 'Alright. Then how many times in a month you might be using glucometer? In a month I use glucometer for 20 to 25 patients.', '20 to 25 patients? Yes. I do for 20 to 25 patients, regularly.', 'Alright. We do diabetes camps as well. Recently we did diabetes test for Raman. You must have spoken with him.', 'Yes, I know Raman Bhai. Yes, during that among those ladies who comes to sing Bajan in Mahila Mandals, we did  checkups for diabetes for about 175 old ladies.', 'Alright. In that there were 30 to 35 patients of diabetes. In that 10 to 15 patients were diagnosed for the first time in that camp.', 'So, it was detected? Yes.', 'That means there is diabetes prevailing over here? Yes, yes. It is there. And we will come to know only when the test is done. It’s not like that we know it otherwise.', 'What are the normal symptoms by which you know that there is diabetes? There are no symptoms. All are beliefs. When people say that, they are hurt, and they are not getting infection and they might not be having diabetes, then this is wrong. It doesn’t happen like that. If a person gets hurt and if he is not getting infection, still he might be having diabetes.', 'Alright. You come to know only after doing the test, otherwise you will never know.', 'Anything else? There are no other symptoms for it? No, there are no symptoms for it.', 'Just now you told me that, suppose if you get a doubt then you would do the test. Then how is that done? Yes, that person might be having complaints like leg cramping and then age factor is there. In those people who has such issues, out of 10, two might be having diabetes.', 'How much does the test you do with the glucometer costs? That test costs 18 rupees.', 'That’s it? Yes that’s just 18 rupees.', 'What are the charges for glucometer? It has to be purchased just once. After that no charges. And it cost around 12,00 to 1500 rupees.', 'Alright. Here you just said that there are patients who got to know about diabetes. Then what type of diabetes is it? That is type A diabetes.', 'That is Type A? Yes. And for the small kids, diabetes is not detected at our place. Only for aged people, it has been detected. Till now it has never happened that any small child got diabetes. There is no such case for now.', 'Then for them do they have high sugar level or low sugar level? No, it is medium level.', 'It is medium? Yes. This means that they don’t have to take insulin. Their work is done by taking medicines.', 'Is it type 1 or type2? No type 2 happens to small kids', 'And type 2? That happens to small children. But it doesn’t prevail here. Till now we have never noticed any such patients.', 'Alright. And they don’t need insulin? No need of insulin. It gets controlled by oral medicines.', 'What are the ideal time intervals to do the checkups? There is no problem if it is done monthly.', 'Every month? Yes, there is no problem if they are doing it in every month. It is different for patients whose diabetes is uncontrollable. But for the patients whose diabetes is controllable with medicines, monthly check up, by fasting and two hours after the food, is enough.', 'How many patients are there with uncontrolled diabetes? There is only one patient till now and he has to take insulin also to control diabetes, because he has got other problems like problem with his retina. So, we had started his consultation in Sanjeevani.  In Sanjeevani the consultation is done as free for him.', 'So, consultation was free for him? Yes. There were no charges for that. He was only charged for medicines and insulin.', 'There is only one such patient? Till now there is only one such patient.', 'Can you give me an exact number of people having diabetes in Tekra? I cannot tell you about the whole Tekra. But till now there are almost 30 to 35 patients who are doing the treatment for diabetes with us.', 'It is going on? Yes, it is going on.', 'Is it in control for everyone? Yes. It is in control.', 'Is there anything that they have to be careful about like in eating and all? Yes. They are not supposed to eat sweets and sugar. But these communities are such that if somebody is offering them Prasadh, then they will hold on to their faith and will not say “No”.  They will not say that “I have diabetes and I will not eat”. Even after explaining to him, he will eat it.', 'What about their food habits, what they eat in the afternoon or in the night? No, we cannot manage that.', 'Do they sugar use in that? No, they don’t use sugar. But they will eat in the way as whatever is cooked for the whole family.', 'No different cooking is done for them? No different cooking is done for them.', 'Alright. And I heard that these people drink a lot of tea. 4 to 5 times, they drink tea. Yes, they drink tea. But those who have diabetes will not drink tea.', 'They won’t drink? No, they won’t drink tea. They won’t use sugar free because finance is the main problem. So, they drink tea without sugar.', 'Okay bland tea. Yes.', 'Did you find it difficult in the beginning with them to make them leave sugar? Because it is not very easy to leave. Yes, it is not easy. But after coming two or three times, they understand.', 'Okay they understand? Yes. We give them awareness by saying that, “On one side you have to take medicines and if you continue taking more sweets, then you have to buy more medicines. And then the expense increases. On top of that if it is not under control, then your body also will get damaged. You may have paralysis attack, your vision might get affected, your kidney might get affected”.', 'So, you have to scare them. Yes. Scaring means explaining to them. After explaining they stop taking sugar.', 'Then they will not take at all, except for these small things like Prasadh? Yes. They sometimes take such things. But they will stop taking sweet things regularly in their house.', 'Do you have any patient who admits that they as went for weddings and they ate sugar on that day? Yes. Sometimes it happens. But if you become too strict on a patient, then he might get frustrated and might end up in eating more. Rather than that you have to tell him that, “If you ate only some time, then there is no problem. If you ate only once, then there is no problem. But don’t eat regularly”.', 'They should not eat regularly. Once in a while is okay. Yes. They are not supposed to eat regularly. Sometimes if you go for a wedding and you feel like eating, then you can eat. But don’t do it regularly.', 'What? Don’t eat regularly.', 'Do you feel when you talk to them that they are feeling guilty, that they were not supposed to eat, but they ate? Or it doesn’t affect them, and don’t they think that much? No, they understand once we explain it to them.', 'No, not like that. You explained, that’s fine. Sometimes they eat and tell you with guilt that they ate. No, no. They don’t feel guilty like that.', 'They don’t feel? Just ate. Yes. Listen when we explain to them they understand and if they eat they tell us as well. It’s not like that they hide from us.', 'Alright. They tell you. Are there any such patients, either it can be by their own wish or suppose if a relative comes or they go for a marriage and then they are forced like “You must eat this” or “You have to take, as you are the elder person of the house”. Because here in Gujarat there is the custom of forcing for having food. So, do they eat under that pressure or do they eat on their own wish? No, they eat because of pressure only. Otherwise they don’t wish to eat. And not all patients are like that, as they eat when somebody forces. There are patients who tell that “I have diabetes and I don’t want to eat”.', 'Only few people are like that? Yes.', 'Also there would be patients with cholesterol or those who have to eat less salt, right? Do they have that much will power to leave such food items? For those who have heart diseases, the treatment is done in government hospitals. So, when they come to us we explain to them, that you have to eat less salt, don’t take much stress, and take medicines regularly and do regular checkups. Then they avoid taking the extra salt on the top. But they don’t do separate cooking for them. They eat the routine food. They keep a caution and make sure that they don’t take extra salt on top.', 'So, they don’t have will power to stop it completely. No, they will not stop completely.', 'They cannot stop it. There’s no need to stop it completely.', 'But if there’s a need, then do they have will power to do? It is not possible to cook separately. That’s not possible. Because in that more expenditure and he don’t want the expenditure to increase.', 'Same is the case for sugar? Yes. It is same for sugar also.', 'Whatever is being cooked, will get cooked? Yes. It is like that only.', 'The person himself avoiding is a different thing. But it’s not that like the people in the house will support him. No, no it’s not happening.', 'Then these people must be knowing that its harmful to take these sugar or avoiding it will benefit their body? Yes, they know.', 'Everybody knows. But they don’t follow? Everybody knows.', 'Everybody knows? Yes.', 'So, everybody knows. It is because of the camps that you did? Yes. We do regular awareness camps and when they come to our place, then we explain to them. So, they get benefit from that. So little bit will go in their mind. Definitely.', 'Do people have hyper tension over here? Hyper tension is there and at our place, for hyper tension medicines are given. We give medicines for 50 percent charges. Emlodopill and Etenol are given regularly for the patients at our place. There are such patients also, who regularly comes to our place and take medicine for one month.', 'Hyper tension medicine? Yes. Before we never use to keep hyper tension medicine. But now there are regular patients and they take medicine regularly. So, we have made medicines available at our place.', 'So, they get benefit of that. Yes. When it comes to going to medical store and taking medicines, they cannot take. They will not go there to buy medicines. That’s why we have made medicines available at our place.', 'Before there were no patients and now there are patients. For that do you see any reason? No, mainly because of age. Otherwise there is no a particular reason that you can find out. Before it was not there. Now it has come. So, you will not get any particular reason for that.', 'So, in their regular diet there is no much sugar used? No.', 'Only for tea or hardly something is cooked in a week? Yes. If there is some marriage somewhere and if they have that food, then only it is used. Otherwise regularly it is not used.', 'Then in that case what could be the reason for getting diabetes? There is no reason for getting diabetes. It depends on the type of body and the nature of the body. It is not like that the person who does a lot of work will not get diabetes or the one who sits ideally will get diabetes. It is not like that. The one who pulls cart, he also gets diabetes.', 'But till now you didn’t come to know the cause for that? Nobody knows the reason. Till now nobody knows the reason for the diabetes.', 'No not like that. It is used to say know, that, see my grandfather had diabetes then my grandmother keeps telling my father that “You don’t eat sugar, because grandfather had. So hereditary will pass on to you”. So how it is told hereditary, so like that diabetes is a hereditary disease, no? It comes into hereditary diseases, but it is not that everybody will get it hereditarily. Out of everybody only 50 percent will get. Suppose your grandfather had, so there are higher chances for you and your brother or sisters getting it as hereditary. That doesn’t mean that if you don’t take sugar now, you will not get. You may get and if your sister is not eating sugar she also might get it. And the one who is eating might not get. It can happen like that also.', 'Then suppose this is one reason for diabetes, then it passes on as a hereditary disease, whether you eat or don’t eat. Yes, in that there are higher chances.', 'Yes, there are higher chances. Like that which are the other things by which diabetes can take place? For that there is no such things that can be told. There is nothing like that. There’s no cause.', 'Are there any cases with hereditary over here? Suppose in a person’s body there is a problem in pancreas. Then there are higher chances for that person getting diabetes. Otherwise it depends upon the nature of that person’s body. Otherwise it is not like that diabetes is hereditary. There are chances for getting diabetes, but not everyone will get it. It’s not like that also.', 'Then you talk to patients then there are patients who have started tea without sugar. Is it that now they experience better? Yes.', 'So, it is good? Yes. Suppose they were drinking tea with sugar before, and they had to take higher dosage of medicines. Now it is controlled with less medicines. So, he feels happy for himself.', 'So, he is satisfied. Yes. In less expenditure my diabetes is controlled. We explains to them that you had controlled your diet, and so that you are not having sugar and you are having tea without sugar. Therefore, it is controlled. So, when these things go inside his mind then he will avoid sugar.', 'See, doctor and patients are frank to each other, right? So patients tell everything.Then do they tell you sometimes that “Sir, I find this as very bland. I am taking it because you had told me so. Otherwise I am not enjoying it” or “I don’t feel satisfied”. Yes, they say like that also. But then slowly it develops into a habit.', 'Yes, habit develops. Yes, starting problem will be there. Initially they use to say that “Sir, without sugar I don’t like it as I feel it as very bland”, but afterwards they develop that habit. Then they drink tea only without sugar.', 'Yesterday we had went to Rudra Center. There, when we were talking with the ladies, we came to know that they all have the habit of having tea. And so if they are leaving their home without having tea, their mood will become off and their mind will not work and like that. So did your patients feel these type of problems before while leaving sugar? Because it can so happen that even if there is occurring a slightest difference in the milk, sugar or tea powder, then they will become mood off. But after explaining to him, he will become okay.', 'Yes, that can happen. But they will face problems in starting. Yes, they face these kinds of problems in the beginning.', 'Do you tell them to do exercises? Their whole day work is like an exercise by itself. So they are not going to find extra time for exercising. So there is no need in explaining them or wasting time in that.', 'Alright. There are many people like males who don’t go for work and who keep laying down after having alcohol. Do such patients, like who have fallen sick out of them, come to you? Then to the person who is alcoholic and who is the single person who is disturbing the whole family, I won’t try to explain to him. I would avoid him. I won’t explain to him and there is no need in wasting time in that. This is from my 20 years of experience.', 'There will be no difference, and this is your experience. There will be no difference and I am 100 percent sure that he will drink alcohol. So there is no need to waste time. Rather you need to work for the person who might improve and change. Then you will get some result. Do you understand?', 'Okay. Do any ladies come over here, who have the need of doing exercise and then you suggest to them? No, no.', 'Here everybody is doing physical work. Yes, everybody here who are patients, do physical work. Then get up early in the morning at 4’o clock, go by walking and pick the garbage around the area. He picks papers. Their entire exercise is done. Then those doesn’t need to do any other exercise.', 'Then how about children? Do they need to do exercise or no? No need.', 'Children are also fit. Yes, they are also fit.', 'Diabetes affects different parts of the body. Is it so? Yes.', 'In that case, which parts of the body gets affected the most, for the people over here? Over here, mostly people’s kidney is damaged.', 'Is there any reason behind that? Suppose if he is a male, then it is because of addictions like tobacco, alcohol and all. So in that liver and kidney are affected. In case of males, more cases are like this.', 'So, is it kidney? Yes, kidney.', 'I have heard a lot that if a person is getting diabetes once, then there are other sicknesses as well, that follows it. Like varieties of sicknesses. So, have you observed something like that like at first a person had only diabetes and later he started to have some other problems. Even if diabetes is coming under control, it might lead to some other diseases and again because of that some other diseases and so on. This is a wrong way of thinking. See, because of diabetes everything is happening, and body parts are getting affected. But when the diabetes is under control then that damage will be less. But if it is not controlled, it can cause damages. But people are not understanding this. That’s why they are saying that because of diabetes these problems are happening. But if it is controlled, then the damage will only be caused after many years. This damage may occur earlier, if it is not controlled.', 'Then for the patients in this area, who has diabetes, which other body parts are affected the most? It use to cause paralysis, CNS gets damaged and also kidney gets damaged. And here, till now nobody has got gangrene. But in my hospital, I have seen such patients who has got even gangrene and we have to put him on dialysis as well. Till now, at least that has not happened.', 'Mostly, it is paralysis. Yes, or CV stroke or cardiac problems.', 'Cardiac arrest? Yes, that problem is there.', 'You are working here for 20 years. So, compared to before, now the cases of diabetes has been increased or was it more before? Before, there was no awareness. So, they never used to come for checkup, whether they are having diabetes or not. Now everybody has got awareness. So, everybody does the checkup by coming to our place.', 'Alright, that means right now you know more. Yes.', 'Do you feel that in future there will be more cases. Yes, yes. There will be more cases.', 'Do the people know about diabetes, like what is diabetes and all. Yes, yes.', 'How much do they know? Like should not eat sugar and should take medicine regularly. They know all that.', 'Do they know before you tell them itself, that once a person is getting diabetes, which are the other parts of the body that gets affected? No, they don’t know these things. They don’t have that much of awareness.', 'So they know only this much that there is a disease called diabetes and in that you should not eat sweet. Yes.', 'And they have to take medicine regularly. Yes, they know that as well, that they have to take medicine regularly.', 'Do they have the feeling that the diabetes can be cured or cannot be cured? In that case, when they come to us and when we explain a lot, then they become serious about it.', 'Then they feel that it can be cured. Yes. After that they get awareness that by taking medicine, it will not cause much damages to the body, which otherwise would take place. They understand that.', 'You said that in night also patients use to come to home or hospitals. Yes. They come in the hospital.', 'So, do they call and come? Or they just come like that? They use to call and come.', 'Do they call and come? So, do you give your number to everyone? Everybody has my number.', \"So, \\xa0do they have Glucometer in their house or no? no No, they don't have. They cannot afford that Glucometer in their house.\", 'Is there a need for that in their house? \\xa0Is it necessary, if we could buy for them and give them at a cheap rate? Yes, \\xa0those who have diabetes, need it for sure.', 'So, they need it. Yes, it is necessary and is required 100 percent because if they are checking it regularly at home, then they will realise that whether the diabetes is less or more and what is the situation.', 'I wanted to ask you, whether you have observed that the diabetes patients who comes to your place uses phone? Yes.', 'What type of phone is it? Is it touch-screen? No, no. It will be simple.', 'Will it be with simple features? He may not be having his own personal phone. \\xa0But in a house there will be at least one mobile phone.', 'For what purpose do they use the phone generally? They use it for their personal work.', \"No, \\xa0for example,  we do conversations, also send messages, listen to songs. No, they don't use messages and all.\", 'Only for talking? Yes, only \\xa0for talking.', 'Do they use internet? No, nobody.', 'Suppose they are taught. \\xa0Then will they use? No.', 'No? That will not work.', 'No? Alright. Like how we are doing surveys, \\xa0like that big companies also use to do surveys. For example, \\xa0if there is some medical companies, then they would come and ask you that “Did you give medicines of other companies” and all. They would come and ask, since they are doing survey. They might take and a form and would fill it. So like that if we want to talk to these people, then is it good to talk to them face to face or is it good to call them and talk to them or should we send a message to them ? Which method is good in that case? At the most you have to go for face to face. In that you will get the most effective answers.', 'Will that be more effective? Yes.', 'Many times we use to receive messages from companies, saying that “You had spoken to our operator and how was your experience? Reply to us”. Do these people reply for that? No, no.', 'No? There is also another thing, that you may receive a call in which there will be a sound like of robot or something, where a lady will be speaking like “Press 1 for good. Press 2 for bad.” But they will not listen to that.', 'They will not even press the buttons as well. Will they disconnect it directly? Yes.', 'Suppose we call and ask, then would they at least talk to us? Yes. If you are calling them directly, then they will talk to you.', 'So, at least they will talk to us. So that seems like the best way. Yes.', 'Suppose if we are making an app by which their glucose level keeps getting monitored. It could be in any way like by doing messaging or by calling or any other way. If we are making them aware about this, then will they use it? That can be tackled only by making a call to them.', 'Our plan is so that…. With messages you will not get a reply.', 'We won’t get a reply? No.', 'We are thinking that if those patients are having glucometer in their houses and when cheap strips are provided to them, then using the strip you just need to see the color. By seeing the color you will come to know that whether it is in control or not. Then if we are making such an application in the phone, similar to that with whatever colors that comes in the strip and numbers besides them, like one number besides red and other number besides blue color and if they are pressing the color that is displayed on the strip, then it will be gone to the database of the doctor or whom so ever is handing the system. And there may be also some extreme cases. Like, for example, when the color red is shown, then the doctor will be flagged. Then doctor can call and ask questions like “What has happened” and then can fix the appointment. We are thinking something like that, because if they are coming to you everyday, then there will a big queue of 70 patients or so. They will have to sit. You time will also be wasted. And the work needs to be done is only for 5 minutes. You just have to change the medicine. That’s all. Then if we are explaining this to them, then will they use the phone for this? No, I don’t feel that they will do that.', 'No, \\xa0are they little orthodox like? Like the way of thinking is a little bit closed. Yes, \\xa0they are not that much serious in this matter and the main thing is that they cannot manage it.', 'Can’t they understand? Yes, \\xa0that is the main thing that they cannot understand.', 'Suppose, \\xa0if we are helping them to buy the glucometer, then can they use it by themselves? Yes, \\xa0that they will do on their own.', 'Then we can tell them this way only that ”You give a call and inform on this particular number”. Yes, that you can do.', 'Will that work? Yes.', 'Only that much. They will not be able to manage the rest of the things like applications and SMS. When they want to check diabetes, they should come to the clinic in the evening and get in recorded in right. That can be done. And then we have to keep the data for that.', 'Yes, then we have to keep the data. That will not be a problem.', 'Then who so ever is the operator can call and tell that “I had done the checkup which I had to do, at this date and time and it has shown this color” In that case we have to do arrangements with Raman. As soon as the person is geeting checked, it is passed on to Raman directly. So that can be done.', 'Yes, it will not be coming to you. Yes, it will not come to me and it will be convenient for the patient as well. So, it can be done as the direct message reaches to Raman. That can be done.', 'Then Raman can check, since he can understand that it has come to this level, right? So he can inform it to you. Can that be done? Yes, that can be done.', 'Alright. Or else when the patient checks diabetes with the glucometer, he can come to clinic and inform whatever the result is. He can come from home by walking 5 minutes and can sit here for 5 minutes and inform us and go. That can also be done. But if you ask him to message, that is not possible. He cannot manage that.', 'Yes, he cannot manage that. He will find that as boring.', 'Then do these people use phone to talk to each other internally or do they directly go to and talk to them? I didn’t understand.', 'Suppose there are friends who stay in the same lane. Then will they talk to each other through phone or will he just go to his house? Now you got it? No.', 'See, how we came to your place. It is not like we called you and asked you like “Where should we come?”. We were just close by. So, we just came. Like that if it is nearby like Gandhi Ashram or the office of Manav Sadhna, or somebody is staying in the next lane, then? In that case they will come to the clinic.', 'They will come clinic. No, I am not telling about clinic. I am talking about they themselves talking to each other internally inside the community. The clinic is outside. What is their way of living internally, within themselves? How would they talk, if they want to talk to each other? Do they talk on the phone or will they visit and talk? They will go to other’s house and will talk.', 'Would not they use phone? No, if they want to talk to each other, then they will go to their place and talk. They will not call.', 'They will not use phone? No.', 'Do youngsters use phone? Yes, nowadays in youngsters, everybody uses phone.', 'Full? Yes, and they are using even the phones with touch-screens.', 'But in youngsters, there are no cases of diabetes, right? No.', 'What type of electronic devices do these people have in their houses? Do you have any idea? In electronic devices they don’t have anything except fan.', 'Nothing else is there like TV, AC, fridge and all? TV will be there. But just 15 to 20 percent will only be having fridge. There are no other electronic devices.', 'Do these people stay with internal harmony with each other? No that is also not the case.', 'So what kind of problems do they have? They have their social problems. They stay, but it is not like that they are staying with harmony.', 'Will there be fights every day? Still it happens. Yes, such things will remain in Chaul system. This will remain in the community.', 'So, there don’t have the thing like unity in a community. No, such things are not there. They have internal problems. But if there is having a problem from outside, then they will get united.', 'Yes, like that. That will happen. But they don’t get along well with each other internally.', 'Not at all? No.', 'Then what could be the reason for that? That is their mentality.', 'Okay, mentality. Then in what type of matter do they have clashes. I cannot say that.', 'Okay, let it be then. Which are the languages these people know? They understand only Gujarati.', 'Do they understand only Gujarati? Yes.', 'Is there any eating habits that these people have, which you feel as bad habit? Non-veg.', 'Non-veg? Yes,  they eat dirtiest non-veg. They eat dirtiest meat, and everybody eats. In this community, everybody eats.', 'Not good non-veg means? Is it the quality of the non-veg which is not good?  \\xa0Or is it only as per you, non-veg should not be eaten? Non- veg should not be eaten. But even if they are eating, it is of last quality.', 'Alright. And because of that they face more problems. Yes.', 'They falls sick. Yes.', 'Then is there any other thing? For example, I heard like they use to eat too much of chilli. Yes.', 'That means they eat chilli beyond the boundaries. Yes, they eat chilli beyond the boundaries.', 'Then is it bad for the body? Should they reduce or should they stop eating chilli or let them continue in the way they are eating? They should reduce it for sure.', 'Okay, they should reduce. Then do you have any other thing like as we said about chilli? Is there any other thing which they use regularly? They use to put lot of spices.', 'Is it hot spices? Yes. They put too much of hot spices. And so they get problems because of that.', 'Alright. They want taste. Everybody wants taste. But they eat maximum chillies.', 'We have heard about lot of problems of acidity. Yes, it is there.', 'Is it because of that only? Yes, it is because of that.', 'In rice do they eat plain rice, like are they using white rice? They might not be having brown rice, right? No, they eat plain rice.', 'Do they give you samples? Yes. They give samples and we utilize it. We use samples for poor patients.', 'Where is it done from? They keep samples here only. Then they are kept in next room where we divide them. If they give us five boxes, then there will be at least 10 tablets. We have research staffs and when they are free right now, they might be doing it. We mix the tablets and then we reduce the number of boxes from five to one. We have made divisions in the cupboard. In the division of blood pressure, we keep blood pressure medicine. In the division of diabetes, there would be two drugs, three drugs or four drugs and like that we have made groups. So, accordingly we divide. So, when a patient comes and if he got prescribed for any of these medicines, I will have an idea that we have that medicines here or not. Then I will tell the boy that these medicines are there in three drug box. So, he will give it to him. He gets that much support.', 'Yes. He gets that much benefit. We give mostly to poor patients and not to those who can afford medicine costs because those who can afford doesn’t value it much.', 'Yes. He will feel like why I should take these free medicines. Yes, free medicines. He will not have value those free medicines. For the other person two hundred is being saved, and his will work will be done.', 'We met Poonam Bhai who runs a clinic in Tekra. There, if a patient comes and visit again then he may not remember. If the person goes once in a week, he may remember. But if the person goes after three months, then he may not remember. Yes. Right. If the person comes after three months or four months, then he may not remember.', 'We have our sir in Dubai. Ali sir. He has developed a system, like as you do data entry know, which they are using here right now. There, everybody is given a card of Manav Sadhna and in that there is a RSID strip. So, at Poonam Bhai’s place, one person will sit with a scanner, so when a card comes it will get scanned and a direct record is generated in that. (Phone comes to Jaldeep) People over there are already using this. Since you use software the most, you will have an idea to check if anything is required in that or anything is less, or anything is required to get added in this. If there is something good, then you can tell us that also. Can you open data of patients?', 'We have our sir in Dubai. Ali sir.

If there is something good, then you can tell us that also. Yes, name is written, then city and basic patient type and what he is like whether he is BPL.', 'Whether he is below poverty line or above poverty line or how poor he is. Then there is gender. And there is photo. These are the basic details. Now we will access patient’s details. What is there inside is that there are four seasons. In the first one it is general information, date of birth, registration date, name, son of whom so ever, gender, blood group, patient type, all that is here. After that next is for communication, like address, phone number, those details are there. After that there comes history. In history there are two main columns. One is history, and another is status. In history there are two things. One is patients’ history and the other is family’s history. Now if you see this, you can see that hyper tension is there in family history. Then there are chances that because of that he gets hypertension.', 'Whether he is below poverty line or above poverty line or how poor he is. Yes. There is possibility of having hypertension in that way.', 'Whether he is below poverty line or above poverty line or how poor he is. Same is the case with diabetes.', 'Whether he is below poverty line or above poverty line or how poor he is. Yes.', 'Whether he is below poverty line or above poverty line or how poor he is. With the help of that, if a person comes and if he doesn’t have diabetes, then now we can warn him to be careful of diabetes, as there are chances. Then if somebody has diabetes, then there are chances for that person to have heart disease or to have stroke. Then we can warn him for those things. Then there is his exact statuses like whether he is a smoker or not and whether he consumes alcohol or not. So, it is related with these things. So, it’s a basic system. Before there were lots of tabs in this, like for example in this you have a lot of tabs and it’s a complex system. It was a lot like that before, but Poonam Bhai sees everyone in two hours and the patient number comes around seventy. So, he cannot give more than one to one and half minutes to a patient. So we had to remove those tabs.', 'So, we made everything in one line. Before it has to be clicked using different tabs. There were five or six different tabs. There were more data in it.', 'Now you give us your feedback. There is no place to write the details of treatment in this?', 'No. Symptoms are covered. Okay. What problem he had? Where is the symptoms part?', 'Here it is. See it is written like, is it his first visit or not, what is history, medications, for what reason he has come and what are his complaints. Yes. Everything is there.', 'This one is for the job. There are two or three programs together in this. This is for job like where are the positions available, where are the jobs offers available. These all are there. What is their work or job, that is also kind of investigation only. Yes. That is also necessary.', 'Now let us see the basic history like how many times he came before. Like he came on 09/04, he came for physical examination and it was a second follow up. So, this is the entire history of his visit. Also, how many times he came. Then this is about medication. This whole thing is live. It will not save right now directly. It is online in server, so internet is required. So whatever medicines are prescribed, it will come in this. Right now, there are no medicines prescribed for this What do we have to do to prescribe the medicines? Do we have to select it directly?', 'That is to be done by data entry. So, you have to put the data inside. It’s not like how it is in your system. Is it not to be selected?', 'That is to be done by data entry. So, you have to put the data inside. It’s not like how it is in your system. No. that means this one thing is less as per you.', 'That is to be done by data entry. So, you have to put the data inside. It’s not like how it is in your system. Yes. There is this one thing less in your system.', 'Right so that the work will speed up, right? Yes, because when the treatment is written then doctor knows. He writes mostly two or three products. Like this one for the economy class, this one is for the middle class and this one is for the higher class. In the diabetes, in the blood pressure and in everything. It is like that. In that whichever medicines are selected they are highly prescribed. Because he knows that brand also. He knows through the brand name. Like for example, if they say a product for diabetes then it can be like Glenium 1 which is priced at par and is not very economical. I mean it’s of medium price, so we can write it to a normal person. But when a poor person comes Glimsium S1 or Unison, such products can be written. So, accordingly we can get such products. There they might be using the local medicines. They don’t prescribe medicines there.', 'Yes. They make it a packet and give. Yes. They make packets and give.', 'Yes. They give samples only. They put it in a packet and give it to them. Like this is the morning packet and this is the evening packet. So, at the most that only is done. They don’t prescribe or write the medicines, right?', 'But just for keeping records, it is right to make provisions for that. Yeah. Then there are not much problems that whether they are giving PCM or anything else.', 'What you are saying is correct, that if there is a list, then even if they are giving, we will have a record. Yes, like suppose paracetamol is given three times a day and many a times some products are like this, that when we prescribe it today for the first time, for example, if a patient has come for diarrhea and we wrote a combination of Ornidazole\\xa0with\\xa0Ofloxacin. But there are many patients like in 1000 patients, 10 patients would be such that they get reaction with Ofloxacin. Then that patient will take the medicine and might come back immediately by saying that “Sir, you had prescribed this medicine and I got allergy because of that”.', 'What you are saying is correct, that if there is a list, then even if they are giving, we will have a record. For the patient whose diagnosis has been done, the treatment needs to be prescribed from computer.', 'Is it from the computer? Yes, from the computer. Then we give print out of the prescription to the doctor.\\xa0 Out of that he will take one and give it to the patient.', 'Alright, that means doctor will not prescribe. Yes, I do the prescription. Doctor will tell that, “You write this medicine or that medicine”. Usually I will be having an idea, as I am sitting here for 15 years. So, for example if there is a diabetes case, so I would know which type of medicine is given when it is detected for the first time. So I get that idea. Doctor also guides. Sometimes if wrong medicine has been written, then he will change it from inside.', 'Alright, so now the patient came. Alright? Then to whom he goes first? He sits here only, next to sir.', 'Not here, outside. Outside at the reception.', 'At the reception? You will be inside only? Yes, I will be only inside. Receptionist will register his name and make them\\xa0sit. When his number comes, he comes inside. We have two divisions. Some patients are Nimish sir’s\\xa0patient and some patients are Bharat sir’s patients. Bharat sir’s patients come towards here,\\xa0and Nimish sir’s patients go on the other side.', 'Then, which is your seat? The seat where you are sitting is my seat.', 'From where do you do the data entry? (shows the place) From here.', 'From here, alright. Sir sees from here, and I operate from that side and there is a keyboard on both the sides.', 'And both are working at the same time. Yes, both are working at the same time.\\xa0 Both are wireless, it can be operated from both the sides.', 'So, then the doctor does diagnosis. Yes, he checks the patients.\\xa0 Like if there is a confirmed fever, then we start the routine treatment,\\xa0like for fever, Analgesic or something like that and then we do the tests. Or sometimes when the patients come with the reports\\xa0directly and it is already diagnosed that he has malaria, then we just have to write the treatment for malaria.\\xa0 Then we will explain it to the patient and will give the print out of the prescription to him. Then sir would explain to the patients that, “You have to take this treatment”. Also, we explain everything in Gujarati. Our prescription is also in the local language like “This medicine should be taken in the morning or in the evening and take the medicine after\\xa0the meal or before the meals”. Also, we tell them orally about the other precautions that has to be taken.  Also secondly, there is a book of diabetes. In the book it is been written that if a diabetic patient is there, then what is to be eaten, what is not to be eaten, which exercise has to be done, what type of food has to be taken, what are the cares to be taken, what happen if diabetes is reduced.\\xa0All those things have been written in that book. “What happen if the diabetes is reduced”, the problems for that is also written. If it reduces too much, then to control that what has to be done. The tablets for that is also written inside. When the patient is coming for the first time, then we will write and give him. Also we keep sugar tablets with it. Then if the person is at home, then he can have anything with that sugar tablet, like lemon juice, or if they are travelling in the bus, then at that time we will not have sugar with us, then he has to keep that tablets in his pocket.\\xa0So, we explain all these things.', 'So, everything is explained. Will you open the book\\xa0and explain everything? Yes. We show them the book and explain like what are the tests that need to be done and when. All the total instructions are written in the books.', \"So that means doctor will not tell you the medicines and you will decide on your own. Yes. But that means I have an idea like Glinipride or if the patient is obese, then Metphormin is to be started or if somebody is of medium weight, the person who doesn't have much height and\\xa0body, then those patients have to start with Glinipride or for them some combination has to be started. As a patient, depending on whatever is his situation.\", 'So you have that much experience and can judge. Yes, because of that we have learned a few things, but many times sir use to guide me.', \"Yes, sometimes he has to guide you, alright.  Now the software you are using, which software is that? It is a visual software. It's called VSS. There is a company called Visual Infosoft. I will show you.\", 'For how many years have you been using this system? From the time I have joined here.\\xa0Right from that time, that is from 2001.', 'Right from 2001? Yes.', 'So, for you, has it become 15 years? Yes. 15 years.', '(Interviewer asking camera man to take the video of the system) So, the registration of the patient will be done from outside. Yes.', \"What is the next thing done? Once he registers from outside,\\xa0his name gets entered into today's list. (showing the screen) Here the waiting list is written. Right now, here you are seeing zero, as there are no patients over here now.\\xa0Suppose there are 25 patients sitting outside, then here 25 will be written. If you click here in today's list, then you will get the list of today’s patients. There will be a card made outside which has been kept by the staff over here. When his number comes there are four cards. For example, suppose there are three patients then first will be his card. Suppose his name is Ramesh Bhai, then there will be a card of Ramesh Bhai. When we select his name from here (showing on the screen), it enters in today’s list. As we see here, whatever patients are sitting there in the OPD, all of their names will come here.  Then we have to select from that. So, then his name is loaded. Right now, I am loading from routine patient. This is his last prescription, that is what is the last treatment that has been done. Some patients would do routine follow up. Like diabetic patients or cardiac patients, those patients come regularly. So, his treatment is fixed, that these different types of treatment are going on for him. For this person, right from the beginning he has bronchitis, diabetes and blood pressure. So, right now these treatments are in progress. \\xa0Now, when he comes with the new problem like, for example, diarrhea. Then we write his problem over here. This is the box for problems. These are the parameters, like how much is the BP. If the patient has come with the problem of diarrhea, then it is compulsory to check the BP. Whether BP is reduced or not, then according to that we should increase or decrease the dosage of the BP medicine. If a person has BP and diabetes, and that person has got diarrhea and vomiting, then at first we have to stop this two medicines. This Diamicron and this one, that means the medicine for the blood pressure and diabetes.  Either they have to be reduced or if they are not taking any food, then it needs to be stopped. Then we have to prescribe the treatment over here. Whichever is the fixed prescription for diarrhea, if I selected diarrhea from here,\\xa0then the prescription for the diarrhea is fixed.  This is the prescription for diarrhea and when we click on that, the treatment is written below it.\", 'Ok,\\xa0so it comes with the list itself, right? Yes, and the other medicines are the one which need to be continued regularly. Whereas this one is a temporary medicine. He has to take the other medicines lifelong. So, when he comes again for the routine checkup,\\xa0after one or two months, it will come at that time. But the treatment for diarrhea will be done for now. (Interviewer asking cameraman to zoom out) Then if some local patient is there, who is a Gujarati, then we would give him the print in Gujarati. And if the person is Hindi speaking or a non Gujarati then we give him in his language.', 'Ok, so how many such languages are there in the computer? We usually use Gujarati, Hindi and English, these three languages. Maximum everything gets fixed in these three languages.', \"But does software give you various other languages as well? Yes, it gives.\\xa0 See, it gives Marathi. That's all, so there are four languages. Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati and English. But according to in which ever area you are. Right now, we are in Gujarat, so Gujarati. Or in which state you are, they will use that language.\", 'Yes, that is right. This is about software.', \"So, from here you will get direct print out. Yes, when we give the print out from here to sir, then he will make changes and will sign and give the prescription. We don't give direction to the patients that, “This medicine has to be taken in this way or that way”, because everything is fixed and written. Suppose a person has any question like, “How this medicine to be taken, before meals or after meals?”. Then we tell that to the patients, because there are lot of patients over here and if we keep writing one by one medicines and keep explaining… Suppose there are 25 patients, then we don’t have time to explain 25 medicines to 25 patients. So we give it in the hands of receptionist, that if any patients have any question on medicines, then he can ask to the receptionist or can ask the assistant.\", 'Alright,\\xa0so everything is prefeed in the computer. Yes, we are using it since last 15 years. Therefore, everything is fed. Suppose if the patient is poor, in this block suppose if the patient is from Ramapir Na Tekra, then he is poor.\\xa0That also will come here. So, generally for him we will write economic product, because his cost has to be less. For him the value of 500 rupees is quite a lot.', \"That's correct. If there is a patient who can afford, for him\\xa0it doesn't make a difference, whether the is bill 500 rupees or 700 rupees. Then\\xa0for such patients we do cost wise division. In the tablets of Ofloxacin and Ornidazole, whatever brands are\\xa0available, all those brands are there.\", 'Alright. One medicine might cost around 70 rupees and some medicine might cost around three rupees and 70 paisa. So, in those cases, we write good company, so such things are there. So, we will have good results and he will find it economic as well.', \"Is there any difference in those tablets, as there's so much of difference in the price. Those maybe the research products. So, we write research products for those patients. If we write costly medicine, then the\\xa0patient will not complete those medicines. Many times, it is like, we write medicine of thousand rupees for diarrhea and the patient would not even buy it. They will take medicine for 2 days and leave it in between the of the course. Rather than that, at least he will complete the course, maybe there will be a little bit of compromise in the quality. For 100 percentage, there will be a difference between the medicine from a standard company and a little bit of generic companies. More than generic companies, we only have national and international companies.\\xa0Mostly, what we are using, all are of good companies, so there is no much of quality compromise. And if we get any doubt in any medicine, as we are not getting proper effect, then we hide those medicine over here. So then we don't even see it again.\", \"How do you update the medicine and all which are received by you? Update is done at the reception. If any MR comes,\\xa0every day… From Monday to Friday MRs are coming. They have appointments at 1 o'clock. They take advance appointmentss. If they take\\xa0appointment today for the first time, then he will be called after three months. They get their product added from outside. The same software is operated from outside as well. So, he gets his product added. If there are any new molecules as well, he will get it added. Generally, that boy who sits in the reception can add all routine medicines. Like Ornidazole, Flexisel, they all are\\xa0old models. Suppose in that, if somebody brings any new brand from the company, then I don't have any work in that. I am not needed. He would add everything by himself. If there are any specific new molecules\\xa0which has come come for the first time, then he would not know how to add, like in which group it needs to be put and what is to be done. Then he would ask for my help or till MR and OPD finishes, he would make him sit and then at the end, I will add\\xa0his product, because he don’t know how to make a few groups.\", 'Do MR meet doctors? They meet daily, I mean\\xa0they meet all 4 days.', 'Okay, they meet all the four days. Per day there will be 6 MRs. They will meet, then only we can be updated.\\xa0 When MRs meet doctor, I will be sitting here itself, so that we get the knowledge about the product like what is the price and everything.', 'Okay, they meet all the four days. Yes, they come only for business.', 'Is there any MR to whom you have to say “No” or you had said “No”, like “No, we don’t want your product” or like that. We don’t tell no to anybody. First of all, suppose if there is any unknown company and it has come in the market for the first time or it is generic or local one, then reception staff himself will not give appointment to him. We will give appointment only to national and international companies, for which the quality of the product is good. Suppose if I came in the market today only and tomorrow if I come to take an appointment, then we don’t receive calls from him at all. First you have to create your value in the market, create your credit and then come to us. We will write, only if it is good. We don’t say “No” to anybody. And suppose if he has come inside even by mistake, by some other influence, for example, suppose if there is a relative of yours and if he tell that “Please give him a call” or “Please attend him”, then by considering the relation you might give an appointment. But we don’t use his products. We don’t have experience with that product. It’s new in the market. Therefore, we don’t write that. We write very good products only.', 'Okay, alright. So, we have an idea that among the medicine, which particular medicine can be allergic and so we need to highlight that in his details in computer and in our prescriptions, “That he took this medicine and he got allergy because of that”. So, we have copied it and added it here. Alright? So now nobody can prescribe this medicine to him again. If anybody tries to prescribe this medicine to him, then this prescription should not be done. When we try to write this medicine in his prescription, then immediately red line will come. For example, if it is Nsaid,\\xa0Nimesulide, so in his prescription when we try to write Nimesulide, then immediately red line should come there. So even if we are writing, we cannot prescribe that medicine to him.', 'So, it will not allow you to prescribe it. Yes, it will not allow us. Even if we are trying to change the brand name and write, still it will not allow us.', 'Yes, there will be one component in that as well, so, it will not allow you to write. Alright. See this, it became red. Remaining all are black and white, whereas this one became red. So, we can immediately realize that we cannot write this product for him, as he is sensitive for this medicine.  So, this particular thing will be very good to have.', 'Do you keep history of reports in this? We don’t keep reports. It is there in the software, but at those places where there are less patients, like 10 or 20 patients, can keep that. We don’t have too much of staffs. There is less man power and there is too much work. If we try to store each and every person’s report, we don’t have that much time. Therefore, we don’t store. If there is something important to be noted, like if the patient is having hepatitis and if his acibity is 500, then we will just note down in the complaint box that his acibity is 500. Then when he comes next time with the one with 300, even though we are forgetting about the previous test, from this system we will get the information that last time it was 500 and with our medicine this much improvement has happened. So it is reduced by 200. So that is good.', 'If you see something more, then you will write it down and make a note. Yes, we don’t write everything. But we will write about whatever comes abnormal, just for our reference. Many a times patients also use to tell that these things are there noted in the computer. So, it is okay, if we are not taking it with us. Also, we write the specific diagnosis, that this person has these diseases and in a disease the problems and the tests that comes across are same. Only abnormal reports will be there.', 'In our case the reports can be saved. For example, if a patient has come four times, then on the first day his BP was this. Yes, parameters. These parameters are there with us as well.', 'Is it there? Yes, it is there. Like see here, his blood pressure.', 'Oh yes, temperature… Yes, temperature and everything is there.', 'Yes, it is there. Temperature, weight, height and everything is there. Yes, everything is there. So, if you want to see his details for every time he came, the BP, height and weight of all those times can be seen. See here, the height is 110 and at down it was 80. We are using it manually, so I am not getting an idea about it.', 'Yes, that you type into this directly, no? Yes, we type it out.', 'Alright, no problem. All these things are available in our program and besides this his data will also come. When for the first time the patients come, everything comes into this. There is provision for writing something in detail as well. But because of the scarcity of time, we don’t write that much.', 'Do you think that in this there are some extra things, that like even if those things are not given as well, it is okay? Do you notice something like that during your work? In our software?', 'Yes, during your work have you noticed something like a window opening unnecessarily or something like that? No, in this software everything is selected properly. Even we have removed a few things which we do not need practically. There is one more for education which is there in this. But right now, it is not working. There is some error in that. But in my old software it was there. Sometimes there will be some patients to whom we need to explain things like what the actual problem and all is. Suppose when we tell the patient that there is swelling in the lungs or veins, then we have to explain the patient that where the swelling actually is. So here there is a picture of lungs and here it looks like branches of tree. So, we have to explain them that, on these branches, the swelling will come at this area. (Jaldeep explains this by showing it in the computer). So, these are allergic bronchitis, and these are bronchioles. And these are borders where the swelling has come. So, when we explain such things to the patients, then patient will get an idea about what has happened to him. Patient doesn’t need to do anything after understanding it. We have to do that part. But the patient will feel mentally satisfied by thinking that the doctor has explained about it to me and the sickness is not that serious. So, he will be relaxed.', 'So, when you show this, will it create an effect in the patient? Yes, it affects them.', 'Do the patients become more serious? Yes, they become serious about it and some might become relaxed as well.', 'Alright, so they realize that it is not a very big sickness. If we tell them that you have the problem of breathing, then they think that they have asthma and asthma remains lifelong. But mostly the patients use to have the allergic bronchitis which is a seasonal sickness. So, it may remain there for around one month. Mostly it happens during winter or during the time of season change. When there are causing special changes in the environment, it happens. Then when he has cough at that time, then we can explain it to him that the allergens from out has gone inside and because of that there is a swelling here inside. And the patients won’t take that medicine which is a device with a spray that needs to be inhaled from outside. They think that it is a device for rich people and not for the poor people. They don’t realize that this is the safest way of medication. Steroid inhalation is not much harmful. The local medicine which we gulp more are harmful. We can explain to them that if you take the capsule through that device, then that powder will directly go to these areas. So, it will have prominent effect, as it will reach to the needed place and do its work. So, we can explain like this to them.', 'So, do you explain like this to all the patients regularly? Not to all patients. For diabetic patients we don’t need to explain to them everything. But if there are some specific patients like if somebody is having stones, then he would ask that where he is having those stones. They will have such question. Then we can explain to him like “Your stone is here, at this place. These are kidneys and as far as the stones are remaining in the kidneys it will not create any problem for you. But when it comes out and as it goes into the pipe, then it will trouble you. If it is small like 3 to 4 mm, then it will come out without giving you any pain. If it is 6, 7 or 8 mm and if it gets stuck in between, it will create problem at that time and will cause severe pain. So, you must drink a lot of water”. So, we explain such things. If this stone comes down to the bladder, then it may come out. (Jaldeep explains this by showing these on screen)', 'Yes, it will come out. That is right. So, when we explain things in this way to the patients, then he understands and gets an idea. Many a times when people tell that they have stones, others get scared and ask them “Do you have stones??”. But when we do this, then he can say that “I have stones, but it is in the kidney”. (Somebody asks something to Jaldeep. So Jaldeep says that, “I don’t have time at all. Please call somebody else”). So like this we can explain to a patient.', 'Yes, that is right. Are there any such others features in this program? For this there are not any other specific such features. Those features are the ones which you use regularly. I have downloaded this particular software called BodyWorks, because right now mine is not working, right? That’s why. All these things are there inside that software as well, in the education part. Also, in this the complete history can be saved. Like suppose if we had given medicine today, and many times patients use to come without taking their file and may tell that “Sir, the medicine that you had given me in 2001 has helped me to improve a lot. The medicine that you prescribed me for the last time doesn’t helped me to improve that much”. Some patients use to say like that. Then if we see his data till now, we will get an idea about which medicine was written for him in 2001 and which one in 2012. And with that we will get an idea that which medicine caused for faster improvement. Then we would prescribe those type of medicine. Both may be allergic medicines. But there might be difference in molecules. The molecules in one medicine might be reacting to that person in a good way, while the molecules in other medicine might not be very effective for that person.  Sometimes some medicine is such that if somebody gets sedation, he keeps sleeping too much. Then about that also they use to tell, like “I was feeling very sleepy because of the medicine that you wrote me last time. Please don’t give me that type of medicine”. Therefore, we get complete data from this software.', 'Alright. So, you get the full history. Yes, complete history, right from the time the patient visits for the first time itself. See, this patient has come for the first time in 2004 and at that time he had throat pain and dry cough. Right from there till today how many times he has got cough and all those data is there.', 'Alright. You had purchased this software, right? Yes, this one is purchased.', 'What is the price of that software? When we purchased it for the first time in 2000, the cost was not that much. It was 5000 or 7000.', 'Alright. Last time when we brought the new version with SQL, as there is no problems like data getting corrupted and it was a bit safer, it costed around 20 to 24 thousand.', 'Did you moved it recently? One year back. Software is the same, but only transferred it to SQL. That’s what we did. So the data becomes safer, as we have 78000 patients in this. So, data is there. We keep taking the backups regularly. But still there can be a chance of data loss.', 'Yes. If the data goes, then it becomes a problem. Even if the data of ten days are gone, then also it results in overlapping of other patients.', 'Does this software keeps getting updated? Or is it like it has come for once and that’s it? No, it doesn’t get updated. If you want to get it updated, then you can get it updated. If you want to get some changes done, then you can get it done. Otherwise they don’t send specific updates on their own. There are new versions that keeps coming. Suppose in this system, if a doctor has advised something, then we convey it to them that this particular thing is wrong and remove it as it is not required. Then they make those changes in the new version. There is one more thing in this which is called as standard prescriptions or standard medicine. Suppose there comes a person who have diarrhea and in the diarrhea section these products are already there. So here I can remove those and write a new medicine, which is for diarrhea itself, but by changing the brand name. See, here it is like diarrhea poor patient, normal patient, diarrhea 1, diarrhea 2 and here I made diarrhea 3 as well. Like that we can make new standards. So, this can be done.  We can see the last patient details or before that which patient came and all. Set patient as RX means, if we want to fix the medication for a particular patient, then you can do that. Next one is history. The operative part, we are not using it. Investigation part is also there. We are not using it as well. We can store investigations, if we want to. We can do advises from here. And these are the tests that need to be done when the patient comes next time. So, these are for tests.', 'For tests, right now do you need to write it down with your hands? Yes, we just write it down with our hands and we give it in their hands by telling them that “You have to do these tests”.', 'Okay, so you don’t give printout form. No, no print. Anyhow the patient is not going to see the printed prescription. They just get the medicine and the paper only once. He will give those prescription to the respective medical fellow and he will give whatever medicine is needed for the patient and he will take it. Also, he will keep the file at home only. So, they don’t use it that much.', 'Yes, that’s right. Which software do the majority of the doctors use? Most of the doctors don’t use software.', 'Don’t they use? Nowadays that usage has been increased a little bit. But when we started in 2001, there was only about one doctor in the whole Ahmedabad, who was using this software before us. Now there are some more doctors in Ahmedabad, who use software. The main advantage of this is that, it helps to increase the speed of checking the patients, because for each and every doctor there are many patients. And with that as we are prescribing one by one medicine, we only need to select the names by using this.', 'Yes, that’s right. And there are a few things which are fixed, like in the case of common diseases like diarrhea and all. So, if a patient comes with diarrhea, then the medicine for that is fixed and we just have to select it during diagnosis. From here you can select the diagnosis, so directly the medicine is prescribed.', 'Then all of them are useful, right. Everything is used.', 'In this there are many things that we don’t have. Is there anything that comes into your mind, which is not there in this? Another thing in this software is that the patient’s photo can also be saved. So, if you can take a picture of a patient, then that also can be done. You may not be remembering a patient by his name. Now, when the patient comes, we know that this is the name of this person. But if we want to talk about him later that “This person had this type of disease and we did these things for him”, then we may not be remembering whether his name was Poonam Bhai or something else. But when you see the picture, like this person is Raman Bhai and this is his picture. (Show on screen) Everybody will not remember names. But in this the photograph comes. I were doing like this in between, but now again I had stopped that, because now our staff has changed. See here the photograph used to come. Whom so ever patients’ name has been given, immediately his photograph will come. When we register his name for the first time, we click his picture as well.', 'Yeah, that’s right. Then it fixes properly.', '(To Interviewer 2) Do you remember anything to ask? (To Jaldeep) That day you were telling something about WhatsApp. What was that? Yes, I will explain about that to you. What we do for the patients is that, for whatever prescription has been given by us, my number is given to the patients and we tell them that “For whatever medicine is now going on, you do the testing after one week and you don’t have to pay visit over here, since there is no need for that. You only have to send the report on WhatsApp. Along with that send the prescription of medicine given by us. Then if there is a need to change something, then I will advise you”.', 'Alright. (Showing the phone) It is like this. Suppose there is a patient with glucose like this…This one is a normal patient. (Jaldeep is searching in the phone)', 'So that means it will be the test that he has done from outside. Yes, they will do those tests with and without fasting from the outside lab. After doing both, they will send it to us. If there is a need to change something, then we will do the changes. Otherwise, we will tell them to continue those medicine.', 'Then for some people, if he has high diabetes and requires regular follow up like weekly, fortnightly or monthly to monthly, then how that is done? Then we explain to them that,” You call us every week” or “You do the test every week and send me on WhatsApp”. So, he will do the tests and will send the results and we don’t call the patients here every week. Then he will stop coming by thinking that “Why we have to go every week and wait for four hours with the test result? Rather it is better not to go, because it is only a little high, no? Before it was 500 and now it is 300 only”. If it is being sent on WhatsApp, then he will do it on his own. He will do the tests and ask his son to take the result’s photograph and send it to the sir. So, their children will send it to us. Whenever we have free time, we reply to them.', 'Okay. And in that case if you need to change the medicine, through the phone you will change that as well. Yes, we change those through the phone itself. (Showing phone) See this medicine is there. This patient had less B12, so he has to start intra muscular injection Methycobal for 5 days alternately. So, we reply like that.', 'Yes, that is right. And if he has some question, then he will ask it through WhatsApp like “I have this question. So, can I call you?”. Then we give him time by saying that “You can call at 2’o clock” or whenever we are free. So that we can explain to him peacefully.', 'Then how many such patients are there like that? Are there more patients who do like that thinking “We will also do like that and I will also inform”? We had started using WhatsApp like this only recently. It is not been done for longer time. It is only one year, since we had started this. Also, initially all public did not had WhatsApp. All had become acquainted to it recently, only about six months before. Generally old age people don’t have it. But the children would be using it. We use to tell them that “Your son will be using it. So, you tell him to click a picture of the result and send on this number. And if he doesn’t understand, ask him to call us on this number”. So that person will call us and then we would explain to him that “Click pictures and send them to us”.', 'So, you use to tell like this to most of the patients. To all the patients like those who are literate, those who understands and those who are punctual. We tell like this to all those patients. And for some patients, even if we are not telling them, they will be perfect. They would follow up on their own. Suppose we have 100 patients with diabetes, out of that 40 patients might be such that, even if we don’t tell them, they would be doing their weekly tests. From the remaining 60 percent, about 30 would have improvement. So, it has reached to almost 80 to 90 percent. And the balance 10 percent may not come, since they get bored or are lazy to come here and sit. So, because of such reasons they don’t come. Also, they have the fear that they will have to pay the doctor unnecessarily, while just showing the report. This feeling also is there for many people. Those who have financial problems think that,” If I go there, I have to pay the doctor, as the fee is around 200 rupees”. In this WhatsApp, we are not going to charge anything to just see the reports. For many patients, the treatment is going on like this on WhatsApp, for almost one year. They haven’t come to meet us from the time the WhatsApp had started.', 'Okay, alright. And we don’t even call them here. We don’t have the intention that when they are coming here, we will get the charges. We have no problem in that. Ultimately the patient will become alright, right? That is our intention. Nobody would give consultation on WhatsApp because his practice will reduce. If patient are coming right in front for visits, then….Suppose he is consulting 25 patients and his fees is 200 rupees, then his practice of 5000 rupees is reduced. Because of that, generally doctors don’t advice consultation on WhatsApp. We also know that with WhatsApp our practice is reducing. But ultimately our patients benefit from that. Anyhow the patients who want to come, will come.', 'Yes, that’s true. We will definitely get patients because of our credit and the work done by us. We had never had less work.', 'We are also working on a system which is something like this for chronic diseases which keep going on for longer period. Yes, diabetes.', 'So that the patient doesn’t need to come again and again. Instead of WhatsApp, suppose we design some other applications on phone, like for example, if somebody has glucometer, then he can do the test with the glucometer and it will come to phone. And from the phone, when he sends you will receive it. If any changes are noticed, then you can prescribe medicine or continue as it is. So, he receives that message from the other side. Also, he keeps receiving notifications like “15 days are over, so use the glucometer” or “Do it after a month”. Thus follow up can be done, as those patients might forget as well. Yes, many patients forget.', 'So, if any such application is made, then will it work or no? It will work for sure.', 'Okay, will it work for sure? If you are making such an application, will it be an android based application?', 'Yes, it will be an android based application. But, then all the patients might not be able to use an android based application. For example, this Ramapir ka Tekro area is a lower-class area. For the patients from there, I am not sure that this android based application will be helpful or not. All the patients may not have the phone.', 'At Ramapir ka Tekro, we were doing survey regarding that, like “What type of phone do they use?”. So, I came to know that, in one house at least one android phone is there. It may be a china made or a cheap phone. Okay, any one.', 'Yes, but at least one phone would be there, because even children are using internet. If children are using internet, then it is good.', 'Like how we download WhatsApp, we can download this application. If the doctor tells, they will definitely do that. Yes, they will do it, 100% sure. Also, we can tell the patients, whenever he comes to bring the child who is having a good phone with him.', 'Yes, after that we need to the setting once. Yes, we can do the setup for them. Then it will start.', 'Also, with many doctors, it happens like patients wait for some time and go away. Doctors practice is not going to reduce. Yes, that is not going to reduce, because in India there is a problem. There are only less doctors. That’s why.', 'There are fewer good doctors. Yes, good doctors are less.', 'Alright. Okay. (To Interviewer 2) Is there anything else? No.', 'No? Any time if anything comes, you can contact me.', 'I want to ask about patients details and all. For how many years have you been working here? From 2 years.', 'I want to ask about patients details and all. For how many years have you been working here? 1 year.', 'I want to ask about patients details and all. For how many years have you been working here? 1 year.', 'I want to ask about patients details and all. For how many years have you been working here? For these two people, it is two years. For rest all it is 1.', 'Almost two years. And before that have you worked anywhere else? Or is it only here? Here only.', 'What types of patients come over here? Patients of diabetes, malaria, CV stroke, impulsion.', 'What types of patients come over here? Diabetes, malaria, impulsion, CV stroke.', 'Which are the most kind of patients? Right now, most of the patients are with vomiting, diarrhea and jaundice also is there. These patients are higher in number.', 'Is it because of heat? Yes. It is because of heat.', 'Is it because of heat? It is because of heat or it can be because of water.', 'Is it because of heat? Or it can be because of the food.', 'Type of patient means whether it is middle class, lower middle class or like those who have lot of problems or patients from higher class? All types of patients come.', 'All type of patients? Yes. All type of patients come.', 'All type of patients? If they cannot afford, they will take discharge on the next day and will go to another hospital.', 'All type of patients? They will shift to VS or civil hospital.', 'But which are the higher number of patients who come here? Most of the patients who come here are well-off. Here, this Ranip area is a residential area and because of that most of the general ward patients are people from Rajasthan. Patients doing chemotherapy and all, mostly take only general ward because they are one day patients. So, they don’t take deluxe rooms.', 'And mostly they come from Ranip? Yes.', 'Which are the other areas from where the patients come? Ranip, Naranpura, Anthodia, Usmanpura,\\xa0Kadi Kalol, Mehtab. They come from everywhere. Also, from Kanthoda.', 'Which are the other areas from where the patients come? Ranip, Kalol. They come from everywhere.', 'Which are the other areas from where the patients come? They come from Science City as well.', 'Do they come alone, or will there be somebody with them? Somebody will be there with them. Relative will be there with them.', 'Relative means son, daughter? Either it will be son or somebody else. Like that one or two relatives of the house will be there. When he just came for consultation and if the doctor says that he needs to be admitted, so that person will be there.', 'So the whole group comes? Yes.', 'So the whole group comes? As only one or two also might come.', 'So the whole group comes? In Rabaris, lots of people come.', 'So the whole group comes? We have a Rabari patient over here, down to here, there will be a group standing there.', 'Okay, there will be a group standing. One or two will be there for minimum. Then more might be coming. We don’t know.', 'What are the visiting hours over here? Or can anybody come at any time and meet? Anytime they can come.', 'What are the visiting hours over here? Or can anybody come at any time and meet? Anytime they can come, before 12’o clock in the night they can come, not after 12’o clock.', 'And mostly, what will be your duty? Our duty is to provide the complete treatment. Doctor will write the treatment and that entire treatment is our duty. We have to do ECG and everything. In ICU, doctor will adjust the ventilator and rest of the things, nurses have to do.', 'So, you all are like doctors? Who is there sitting outside? Medical officer. The one who is sitting on the chair is the medical officer. Different officers will be there in morning, evening and night.', 'Among you, who sits there? We also sit there. But mostly there sits the medical officer.', 'So you don’t have to do data entry and all. No, we don’t have to even touch the PC.', 'You don’t have to even touch it? No, that is not our work at all.', 'Then do these patients talk to you? Yes, if the patient becomes closer to us while he is staying here for one month or 15 days, then the patient becomes close to us.', 'Then do these patients talk to you? Some patients become close to us in one or two days as well.', 'Then do these patients talk to you? If a patient is a long-term patient, then he becomes closer to us.', 'And does everybody normally take discharge in one day? Only Dilip sir‘s patient who take chemotherapy take discharge.', 'Rest of them usually stays? One or two days they will be there.', 'Rest of them usually stays? If they cannot afford the charges for the room, then they will take semi or the general one. But patients will be there. And here we have a rule that if a patient wants a general ward and if the ward is not empty, then the patient is put in the semi. But the charges will be as for the general ward. They may put in the special as well, if there is no place. But the charges will be as for the general ward. Then if the general ward is having the space, he is shifted to there.', 'Do you have any idea about their food habits? They usually ask about the food. But dietician decides about that.', 'Do you have any idea about their food habits? We have one dietician over here.', 'Do you have any idea about their food habits? One printout is put in the file and everyday morning dietician makes the plan from today morning till tomorrow morning. The dietitian will write everything and go. He has to eat that way.', 'Not here, in their houses? In their houses what do they eat? Are you asking that?', 'Yes. No, that we don’t know.', 'Or do you know something like while they were having something, they faced some problem and so they came here and like that? If they tell their history, then we come to know that this is what happened, or we went here and this is what happened.', 'Do they tell those things? Yes, they tell. But it is doctor’s duty, to ask the patients history.', 'Yes, that is doctor’s duty, but you would know more than the doctor, because doctors will ask for only 5 minutes. Yes, we know more because doctors take history for only 5 minutes.', 'So, you will know more. That’s why I am asking. In that case, suppose if brother-in-laws have fought, then we would ask what was happened.', 'Then will they tell you everything? Yes, they will tell us everything.', 'Okay, give me one or two example. Right now, it is hot outside and it is season of marriage. So if they have gone out and ate something, they would tell us that I had eaten outside.', 'Okay, give me one or two example. “We went outside, and we ate, so because of that we got vomiting. I waited for one day but it did not get cured. So, I came to show”, they would say like that.', 'Don’t they immediately come and show? No, everybody waits for one day in the case of diarrhea and vomiting. Even in the case of fever, they wait. If it doesn’t get cured, then they will come on the next day.', 'Is everybody like that? Mostly everybody tells like, “I was suffering from yesterday, so I came today to consult”.', 'Is everybody like that? Many patients use to wait for 2 to 5 days as well and then only they come.', 'Are those patients who wait for 4 to 5 days, belong to the higher-class patient or a little low-class patient? Some of them are good as well.', 'Are those patients who wait for 4 to 5 days, belong to the higher-class patient or a little low-class patient? Those who are good, are aged.', 'Are those patients who wait for 4 to 5 days, belong to the higher-class patient or a little low-class patient? They might have gone to another small or big hospital before, and then they come here.', 'Are those patients who wait for 4 to 5 days, belong to the higher-class patient or a little low-class patient? Yes, if it does not make any difference or get cured, then they come here. Then they tell on their own, that if there is a need to admit then please admit us.', 'Alright, then suppose a family has come then in one family approximately how many people will be there? 2 to 3 will definitely be there.', '2 to 3? Yes, then those people will go and then others will come, and then others will come. It will be like that and the person from the house will definitely be there.', 'Okay. Suppose if a lady falls sick, then her husband and children will be there. Yes, her husband and children would be there.', 'Like that it becomes like four people. Yes.', 'So like that, for those who are getting admitted here, on an average how many people would be there in their family? 4 to 5 people would be there.', 'So like that, for those who are getting admitted here, on an average how many people would be there in their family? 2 also would be there. It won’t be fixed.', 'So like that, for those who are getting admitted here, on an average how many people would be there in their family? Mother-in-law and father-in-law would be there.', 'Okay, so mother-in-law and father-in-law would be there. Suppose if children are there, then will they listen to them? Many a times if children are trying to say something, then others will answer back, right? No, they will listen.', 'Okay they will listen. Not like that, see…. Okay, I understood I know what you are asking. That’s why I kept quiet.', 'Suppose they are with doctor or maybe with you, since they are admitted. So children would tell that “Sir, he was eating like this. Despite me telling him no, he was eating like that”. Then there would be arguments and sons would get angry and go away. Do you remember any such incidents? Does that happen? Yes, it happens. (Nurse 7 enters the room) Now, most important person is here, she will give you all the answers.', 'Yes, yes. She knows everything. Let her come. She will give you nice answers.', 'Yes, yes. She knows everything. I saw you today morning. (Everyone laughs)', 'You saw me in the morning at 8.30, right? Yes.', 'At Kadia Naka, those people stand there, know. We had to meet those people as well. When I passed from there in the morning, I saw all three of you there.', 'Yes, there we were doing …. (Laughs) I don’t want to say more about what you were doing.', 'Okay, so the girls and boys listen to their talks. Then suppose if there is a sickness in the house, then doctor tells that you should eats this or should not eats this, and then you will have to take care of those things. They will take care.', 'Will they take care? Yes, they will take care.', 'Do people from the house give support? Yes, full support.', 'Or is it like for them, there is only whatever is cooked in the house? No, no it is not like that. They will not give it at all. There will not be a single item extra than whatever dietician has written.', 'Not here. At home. They will not give at home as well. They would ask on the next day or would call and ask after 5 days that “Can he take this particular thing? He was having liquid till now and can he start having soft food?”. If doctor says that, “Yes, he can take”. Then he will be given. Otherwise not given.', 'Okay, he will not take. So, a lot of care has been taken. Then do those who are coming here take care, so that twice in a week they would have green vegetables or have sprouts on one day or think about nutrition or complete meal? Or do they want to eat fast food or Vadapav and Dhabelly from outside? Where do we go to see those things?', 'No, no. I am asking about whether you have known about those things while speaking to them, not in the other way. No, they don’t know.', 'Okay no. Mostly what types of patients are there? Are they fat or thin? What type of patients are they? Mostly here they all are fat.', 'Okay, fat? I have answered all these questions yesterday.', 'Yes, you had answered. That’s why I am telling no to you, that you don’t come. Those same questions are there.', 'Yes. It is the same. So, why you asked so many questions to me only?', 'Because these people have not agreed. We didn’t know that it would be helpful, otherwise we would have attended yesterday itself.', 'Now amongst you who could be called as thin or fat? She can be called as thin. (points Nurse 3)', 'Okay, is she thin? We are there. Myself and she, both of us. (points at Nurse 7)', 'Do you call yourself fat? As per me, I don’t think that I am fat. I am perfect.', 'Right. As per you, when compared to you, how are the other patients? They are healthy. They are healthier than us.', 'Alright. Do they do exercises or something like that? No, we have never heard from anybody’s mouth that they do exercise.', 'Alright. Do they do exercises or something like that? If they are doing, there might be hardly 20 to 30 percent. When we are explaining to them ,only those who are educated would do.', 'Those who are coming for the first time will definitely be not doing. No.', 'Those who are coming for the first time will definitely be not doing. We can say that people are not still aware of diabetes. We can say like that.', 'What types of exercises are done by those who are doing exercises? What type of exercises do they do? They will be walking in their room, that’s it.', 'That’s all, only walking, nothing else? Many people believe this way that if the patients with diabetes are walking in the lawn in morning with empty stomach, they get more benefits. It is not necessary. I heard like 2 to 3 patients saying that, “I do pranayama in the morning. I have lot of improvement in my diabetes”. In the morning they get up early and drink bitter gourd juice and that also give them benefit. So, there are some patients who control this way. But they are hardly 10 to 20 percent, not more than that.', 'That’s all, only walking, nothing else? That also would be done by aged people, not by others.', 'What is the age group of most of the patients? What might be their age, 40? Between 40 to 60.', 'Not only from diabetes, but from all the patients. Mostly all patients are from that age only. Patients of our age are very less.', 'Not only from diabetes, but from all the patients. 35 to 60, they are more between that age group.', 'You said like patients of your age group are not there. So, which age group patients are not there? The age of 20 to 30, right? (To nurse7)', 'You said like patients of your age group are not there. So, which age group patients are not there? Yes, and there are mostly patients from the age of 35 to 60.', 'Okay between ages 35 to 60. And what are the jobs of the patients who come here? Do they have their own business or are they doing jobs? Do you have any such idea? It is different for everybody.', 'Oh, it is different! But mostly? Somebody might have government job also.', 'They come and may say know, that “Today I left my business and came” or “My leave will be deducted”. Then when they are talking like this, you might get an idea, right? Some have jobs in the mills as well.', 'They come and may say know, that “Today I left my business and came” or “My leave will be deducted”. Then when they are talking like this, you might get an idea, right? Here among the patients who come in this hospital, labors are the highest in number.', 'Okay, there are more labor types of patients. Yes, there are more of labors.', 'Okay, labors are more. Then labor means is it labor job or like that masonry work or something? It is mixed.', 'Okay, labors are more. Then labor means is it labor job or like that masonry work or something? They are more of jobs service.', 'It is service? Yes.', 'So, don’t they have any problems like monetary problems? Yes, they have the feeling that the private one is better than civil. Even though they have to take loans ,they would prefer taking treatment over here in private, rather than going to civil hospital. Many a times they do because of compulsion or helplessness.', 'So that means they might be having monetary problem as well. Yes. It happens.', 'Still they would come here. Yes, in general ward mainly comes these types of patients.', 'Still they would come here. Yes, they are that kind.', 'Still they would come here. Totally, there are that types of patients.', 'So, in general ward, it is like that. So, how many beds are there in general ward? 4 beds.', 'So, in general ward, it is like that. So, how many beds are there in general ward? 4 beds but they are never empty. In general ward, it is always in the waiting state.', 'Which is the other category of beds available over here? Semi special, special, deluxe and general.', 'Then how many are semi special? There are 4 rooms, in 4 rooms there are 2 beds in each.', 'There are four rooms and each room have two beds. So, in total they are 8. So eight plus four, that is 12. Then which is the next category after semi special? Special.', 'Okay special, how many are there in that? There are not many in special. There are more of deluxe.', 'Okay, not much are there for special? And general is always full, right? Do those special and deluxe remain full or are they empty? They are also full.', 'Okay, not much are there for special? And general is always full, right? Do those special and deluxe remain full or are they empty? Special remains full and deluxe remains empty.', 'Okay, not much are there for special? And general is always full, right? Do those special and deluxe remain full or are they empty? This hospital is never empty.', 'Okay, not much are there for special? And general is always full, right? Do those special and deluxe remain full or are they empty? ICU also is always full.', 'ICU is also full? Yes.', 'ICU is also full? All 7 beds are occupied.', 'Are there 7 ICU beds? Yes.', 'Are there 7 ICU beds? There one cot which we keep vacant over here.', 'Are there 7 ICU beds? There are 5 main ICUs and two are step ICUs.', 'Are there 7 ICU beds? We keep one cot empty, for any severe emergency.', 'Amongst the families that come over here, who do think is smarter? Suppose a lady has fallen sick or a man has fallen sick, and his son, daughter, wife, father-in-law and mother-in-law are sitting and talking. As you notice, whom do you feel as the smart person among them? Smart means not medically, but in talking worldly matters. In anybody’s house there would be that one person, right?', 'The person who talks more, who talks to you or who keeps eating your head, and you also get irritated thinking that this person is troubling. They are their sons.', 'Sons are more, right? Yes, their sons do these things more.', 'Sons are more, right? They are educated, that’s why.', 'Then who takes more care of the patients? In their relatives?', 'Then who takes more care of the patients? Usually if the patient has a daughter, then she would take more care. Yesterday I saw in 402, that only is daughter was taking his entire care. If not, then sons would take care. Not the wives of the sons, it is sons.', 'Then who takes more care of the patients? Hardly, there will be sometime when son’s wife would be taking care.', 'Then who takes more care of the patients? That would be hardly 5 to 10 percent.', 'Alright, do you have to force the patients at any time? What?', 'Suppose they are saying no for taking medicines… Yes, there are lots of patients like that.', 'Then what type of sickness do those patients have? Those patients, for whom long term medicines are going on, like in the case of diabetes, they are mainly tired of having tablets, because every day they have to take 4 to 5 medicines, three times a day. Then after sometimes they get frustrated. So, we have to explain to them that even if you are missing one single time, then you have to repeat the entire course again. We have to pressurize them in this way, because they say that “We don’t want to complete the medicine”, so we have to force them. Yesterday itself one girl was given discharge and today she has been admitted again. She has TB of brain, it is meningitis. So, we have to explain to her. First of all, for her we could not start tablets, because she is vomiting. We have to pressurize them or force them especially for long term medicine patients.', 'Those who are new would take? Yes, one or two days or those who have to take for 4 to 5 days, they would definitely take it.', 'Do the people leave the course in between? Many patients do like that as well.', 'Like doctor has given medicine for 15 days and then they leave after 7 days. And after 15 days again they fall sick. Especially patients who are poor do such things. They are tired of getting medicine because of monetary constraint. They don’t complete the course because of that. In those houses where there are no educated people also won’t complete the course, because there is nobody to explain. We explain from here. But there has to be somebody to tell them at home.', 'Then also there might be people who have crossed 50 or 60 and have become cranky. They also will not be taking medicine, in spite of you telling them repeatedly. Whether that person is poor or rich, that doesn’t make any difference. Are there any such patients? Such patients are 5 to 10 percent. Not many.', 'Do patients talk to you openly? Yes.', 'Patients? We only talk to them.', 'Oh, you only talk to them. How much do they know about diabetes? Like by the patient himself. (Nurses are not saying anything) Nothing? It is very less.', 'Oh, you only talk to them. How much do they know about diabetes? Like by the patient himself.

Those who are scared of taking injections would observe those curtailments.', 'How many patients are there who are taking insulins? Mostly all are insulin patients. Here sir starts only with the insulin.', 'How many patients are there who are taking insulins? Here we have to start with the insulin itself as temporary, because most of the patients coming here are quite hyper. There are only less of hypoglycemic, but hyperglycemic are higher. So, for them we have to control with insulin. So, when they go home, we explain to them about insulin and after that the tablets are started. So, mostly we have only the insulin patients.', 'And what is the age group of these diabetes patients? Are they above 40 or 50? I have seen a boy of 11 years old as well, who is having diabetes. But mostly they are of 40 to 60 years of age. We had one boy who is 11 years old, who had diabetes around 545, when it has been detected for the first time. He had jaundice and we have a rule over here that if any patient comes here, at first need to check his diabetes. When we do the test, we directly take it on the strip. So his sugar was 545. When we had checked his acetone, it had come above 50. The boy was 11 years old. He was a patient from Kalol. So, there is nothing decided about patients.', 'That’s right. But I want to know mostly from which category they are. Mostly they would be between 40 to 60.', 'Okay, between 40 to 60. (Nurses starts smiling) Why are you laughing?

Some of them follow, some of them don’t.', 'Majority of them follows. We don’t allow them to eat over here. We tell them to don’t eat this and eat that one.', 'Majority of them follows. Dietician writes and many a times they also ask to us.', 'Majority of them follows. They would ask and only after that they give things like ice cream and all. They would not give on their own. Till they are here they would ask and then only will give. Like can we give him this or not?', 'How about once they go home? When they take discharge, they ask that what are the things to be taken.', 'Then do they come back? They will have appointment after 5 days. At that time, they consult directly with sir. They consult directly with sir and then go home.', 'Are there any such patients whom you have to admit again, like repeat patient whom you would identify like that is the same person?

One more person is there, Ram Bhai Desai. He is also a diabetes patient. So he also keeps coming again and again.', 'How many such repeat patients are there, who keep coming again and again?

Yes.', '50 percent come from out station? There are lot of chemotherapy patients, who come from outstation.', '50 percent come from out station? From Rajasthan, from Amreli. Till Amreli. And nowadays from patients come from very far as well.', '50 percent come from out station? Either Rajasthan, Amreli.', '50 percent come from out station? One patient has come from Bombay also.', '50 percent come from out station? The one who stays in 405, right?', '50 percent come from out station? Yes.', 'Do you say only numbers like 405 and 406? The hospital is of only 36 beds, so we remember numbers.', 'So names are not required at all. The hospital is not very big.', 'So names are not required at all. Wasn’t there one patient who had come, our Anit sir.', 'Amrit sir? No Anit, Anit sir. There was one south Indian patient.', 'Patient came from South India? Patient has come from USA as well.', 'Patient came from South India? (She is trying to remember the name) Kennan or some name like that… That patient came from that side.', 'Patient came from South India? We have received patients from foreign as well.', 'Was it from Kerala? (To Nurse 3) Yes Kerala. A person came from Kerala. He stayed here for long time.', 'Here lots of patients come for chemo, right? It’s going good over here. Yes.', 'Here lots of patients come for chemo, right? It’s going good over here. Oncologists come from outside. We call him every 21 days to give chemo to patients. An oncologist comes for daily visit as well.', 'Which are the other illnesses, for which here the treatment is done? This is a multi-specialty hospital, so all the sicknesses are taken care of.', 'No. But what is it famous for? For example, now you said for chemo. You are giving chemo here, so it is famous for that. Then it is diabetes by Doctor Manoj sir. Like that is there any other illness for which patients are coming over here? For which patients especially come over here? Which other doctors come over here?', 'No. But what is it famous for? For example, now you said for chemo. You are giving chemo here, so it is famous for that. Then it is diabetes by Doctor Manoj sir. Like that is there any other illness for which patients are coming over here? For which patients especially come over here? Jignesh Patel sir', 'No. But what is it famous for? For example, now you said for chemo. You are giving chemo here, so it is famous for that. Then it is diabetes by Doctor Manoj sir. Like that is there any other illness for which patients are coming over here? For which patients especially come over here? For Gastro also, lots of patients are treated nicely over here. Fever patients also come here, for all type of fever like dengue, typhoid and all.', 'Do you have any idea about the people who come down in OPD? Only if they become IPD, then only we come to know.', 'Do you have any idea about the people who come down in OPD? I have done duty at OPD also. So what you want to ask? What you mean by having any idea about them?', 'Okay, in that how many patients would be repeat patients? In OPD how many patients come as repeat patients? If there is a little serious sickness and if they need to be admitted, then they would come up. But how about small sicknesses like they took medicine and they didn’t get cured, so they came again. Then they changed the medicine and then they come back again. Afterwards, they talk with sir on phone. Everyday such phones come.', 'Then do doctors talk to them on the phone? Yes, every day they talk. If regular patients are there, then they would talk through the phone only and ask like, “Sir, what do we do with these medicines?” or “What to do?”. Then we will connect the line to sir who is there inside, and they would talk directly to sir. Sir would talk to them even when the OPD is on. He would take some time and talk to them. Even if there is a slightest confusion, it will get solved.', 'Then do the patients who come here buy glucometer for themselves at home, to check the diabetes? Yes, some of them buy for themselves at home.', 'Do they have at home? Yes.', 'Then how do they inform about the score that comes in their strip? After checking they write it down at home.', 'Then how do they inform about the score that comes in their strip? Sir gives a whole chart for that, like for this date, the diabetes has come this much or for the date 26, diabetes has come as this much. So, like that we have made a whole chart. They would write it in that and if sometimes it is coming onto the higher side and if there are chances of becoming it serious, then we had given them an emergency number. They would call on that number and ask.', 'So, they would show the chart at that time. They would show the chart only when they come for follow up and if it is critical, then they would call up using that emergency phone number and ask us. It’s like that.', 'What would be the cost of one glucometer? Do you have any idea? It comes with in 2000 rupees.', 'How about those strips? Those are little expensive, depending on different companies. Everybody tells that the strips are expensive than machines.', 'Yes, they find that expensive because that needs to be changed every time. Alright. Okay.', 'What kind of patients do come here? We mostly get those patients with loose motion, vomiting, dengue and malaria. Either they will be having fever or might have vomiting and loose motion. Also, patients use to come with breathing problem, which is known as COPD. They are the patients with lung diseases. In that smokers also use to come with breathing problem. And those who have breathing problem with fever are mostly TB patients. So, they come with infection, with TB and breathing problem. So, all these comes in lungs problems. We also use to see pneumonia patients, also patients who come with cardiac attack, patients with myocardial infarction. Also, patients with cerebral CV stroke, whose blood would be clotted in brain or with hemorrhage, come. So, such unconscious patients also come. Patients who are paralyzed also come. They might be having paralysis on one arm and one leg and will be unconscious. They come like that. So, these kinds of patients come routinely. Also, here use to come a hematologist and oncologist. So, their patients also get admitted here, especially for cancer. In that, ladies with breast cancer and ovarian cancer use to come. Gents use to come with the cancer of vocal mucosa, liver cancer, lung cancer and throat cancer.', 'Then mostly which sickness has been seen over here? Mostly fever, loose motion, vomiting and jaundice. These patients use to come routinely.', 'How about round the year? I am talking about round the year itself. These patients are mostly seen round the year. Round the year, we see pneumonia patients, fever patients, loose motion and vomiting patients, jaundice patients.', 'Have you observed any specific pattern that these diseases are prevailing because of such and such reasons. The very first reason is because of food habit. They eat and drink from outside. Also, they are unhygienic. There is a community acquired pneumonia and in that there are people who are immuno-compromised. Those who have HBsAG, HIV or HC infections, are immune-compromised right from the beginning. They get these infections immediately. So, pneumonia happens also because of weather and so they get infections from each other. The swine flu which is going on right now, in that in a very shorter period like 3 or 4 days itself, pneumonia happens. In such cases community acquired cross infection occurs.', 'Mostly from which area do the patients come from? Mostly the patients are from middle class, lower middle class and lower class. Most of the patients who come with diabetes are also from the middle-class family.', 'So, do they mostly come from Vadaj? Yes, they come from Vadaj, from Katilodia, Chanilodia, Naran Pura and only sometimes they come from city. And others come from out of the city as well, that means from the peripheric villages around the area like from the Kalol side, Khadi and all. The flow of these patients is more.', 'If we try to calculate the percentage of middle-class and lower middle-class, then what it would be? It is difficult to find the percentage of middle-class and lower middle-class, because generally those patients are more. Patients from higher class use to come. But they are only about 30 percent. And rest of 70 percent are middle-class and lower middle-class patients.', 'Then for you, do you do interaction only with the patient or do you talk to their family as well? We do interaction with the family as well. We have to do interactions especially with the family. Because of the trend that is prevailing here, we have to do interaction with the family. If they are not satisfied, then there is no joy in doing this work.', 'Yes, nowadays everybody has started to become aware. Yes.', 'Suppose one family has come, then what is an average family size of that patient? His proper family size would be around 4 to 5 people.', 'Have you counted it with only 2 to 3 children or is it including their parents? It is including parents. It will be two children and parents or 3 children and parents.', 'No, I meant to say parents and their two sons. Do they have grandparents or no? Grandparents are not there in every case.', 'Are they not there with everyone? Yeah.', 'Alright. Do the children support them? Here we have seen like, whom so ever brings the patients give full support.', 'So, they do support. Yes. Hardly sometimes like once in a while, may be in 2, 3,4 or at the most 5 percent cases, it happens like they won’t support. Rest all are very supportive over here and they are closely related.', 'Do those patients who come here have financial problems? They have financial problems, especially for the cancer patients and also for those who are being admitted for longer period like those who had got cerebrovascular damage have to be kept in ICU or they will have to stay here for 15 days or a month. Such patients face financial problems and ultimately, they have to take a decision of taking DAMA discharge.', 'So, they do discharge in between. Yes, they stop the treatment and take the patient out because of compulsion. This happens many a times.', 'How many such patients would be there at your place? Such patients would be around 5 percent. Out of 100, five patients would be like that.', 'And how about the small sicknesses which you can diagnose and give medication? Yes, for 3 to 4 days there will be no problem.', 'Then it may not be the case in everybody’s house. There might be some houses in which it would be difficult even to get food, right? Do you know any such patients? Such patients do come in very lower class. But that is hardly 1 or 2 percent. For such patients, we use to do lot of concessions for medicine, sampling and in bill as well.', 'Then you said now that because of food habits there are lot of problems caused for them. Most of the problems are caused because of food habits. Those who are suffering from stomach diseases, like jaundice, loose motion and vomiting, typhoid, are caused because of food habits.', 'Then where do they go wrong? Generally, they are going wrong by eating from outside. The hygienic food that is cooked in house is not bad. May be some might be there in the lower class. But those who are eating the food from outside or those who eat the street food on the road, fall into problem.', 'Mostly what are the things that they eat? They eat pani puri, pizza. In short whatever is cooked on cart and served. In that the dishes are not washed properly.', 'So, there is a problem of cleanliness. Yes. There is a problem of cleanliness. Also food, like how they are preserving the food, when do they cook it, how many days old cooked food is used. Those things also affect.', 'Alright. So, mainly it is the problem with food.', 'When the cook food in the house, are they aware that we should take nutritious food or we should have complete meals. Do they have such awareness? No, that awareness is very less. The awareness of eating nutritious food is there only in higher middle-class and higher class. Still the awareness, that we should take this kind of nutritional food in this way or we should have only this much food like oily food should not be taken, has not come in the middle class.', 'Then what could be the reason behind that? The reason could be lack of literacy or knowledge about health like what type of food should be taken or hygienic food should be taken or in hygienic food what type of food should be taken. That awareness is still not there. Therefore, it is creating the problem.', 'Do those who come here, enjoy eating? And if you tell them to leave a particular food, will they listen to you? Yes, all love food. In spite of giving them instructions, they don’t follow it. For the diabetes patients, we use to give them diet. But, once they go home, they forget everything. And they eat whatever they what to eat. Mostly who comes with uncontrolled diabetes won’t be having proper food habits.', 'How many patients are there having diabetes? Most of the patients come for diabetes.', 'Okay, most patients? Yes, most of the patients come for diabetes. Most of them would be older one, like above 50. Most probably, they would be diabetic. Those who come as heart patient or BP patient would have diabetes for sure.', 'So, both go together, right? Yes, see diabetes is related with heart. Those who have already got diabetes, have high chances for having heart problem. If a person has BP and diabetes, then they have very high chances of having heart problem. It becomes maximum.', 'Alright. To which category, like fat, thin or proper measured body, can we classify the patients who come here? It is not necessary that all the patients who have disease can be fat or obese. It is not like that. Some might have an average body. Some might be thin, and some are obese as well.', 'Okay, it is in a mixed proportion. Yes, mixed proportion.', 'You cannot classify them? No. Even if we try to classify, we cannot see anything specific. But obese people have more problems. There is no doubt in that. But it is not necessary that the person having diabetes, BP or heart problem are obese. It is not like that. It is not necessary.', 'Alright. If we try to see, totally how many patients are coming for diabetes? For diabetes, per month 30 might be there.', '30 might be there? That means one person per day. Yes. On an average, we can count as one per day.', 'On what stage do they come to you? Stage means, see when it is detected for the first time, then we have to count it as uncontrollable. But on an average, those who have diabetes around 200 to 300, are more. And those who have high acetone or those who come with ketoacidosis, we use to see such patients once in 5 or 10 days. Those patient’s diabetes is very high and is uncontrolled and then it become as poison. We would find such patient one in 10 days.', 'Then do such patient, whose disease has gone uncontrolled, would follow your instructions or do they eat anything they want? From here they use to listen to whatever instructions we give. We tell them that you should do these and these things. But such patients always fail and because of that only, these things are happening. Their food habit is bad at home, as they don’t keep curtailments. Only for those people, it becomes uncontrolled in this way. Hardly for one percent it might happen because of some other mistake. For those who don’t take proper medicine and don’t have proper eating habits, the disease goes uncontrolled.', 'Do you have such patients, like the doctor would have given medicine for 15 days and then when he becomes alright in 7 days, he may not complete the course ? It happens. But it is very rare.', 'Is that rare? Yes, it is rare.', 'Okay. That means everybody follows. They will follow. We take care of that and make sure that they do follow. We give them the follow up date and tell them whether the medicine need to be taken or not. We explain to their relatives as well. So, it will be followed. But sometimes hardly for one percent patients it happens like they don’t take medicine properly.', 'Then in many cases their family would not be supporting them. Have you seen such things? Yes, it may happen sometimes that family don’t support. But it is very rare. We have seen it very rarely.', 'Because you said that…. Yes, financially it happens.', 'Financially it would be there. But there will be other things in the house like if you have told a patient to not to eat a particular thing, but then he has to eat whatever is cooked there at home. Such things happen more often. We get more of such complaints. Those who come with grandparents use to tell more complaints that “Even if we tell them not to eat, they are eating. Please explain to them about the food habits. They are not supposed to eat chilli and sweet things. Still they are eating”. We use to hear such things very frequently.', 'Okay, that means you meant to say that patient is not listening. Yes.', 'I am asking about the opposite, that when the patient knows. For example, I am not supposed to eat sugar. But there would be a daughter-in-law in the house and she cooks for everybody at a time. So it would be like “If you want to eat this, eat it. Otherwise, it doesn’t matter”. No, such things only hardly happens. Generally that doesn’t happen.', 'Then how do we prevent diseases in these people? What are the other things done along with medicine? Along with medicine, we have to give them knowledge about the disease, about their food habits. Also have to give them knowledge about their age that, “Now this is your age and your organs may not work as intact as before, so have to take diet in this way”. So like this we can make that person aware about that. Or else some new centers have to be created, where according to the age and the disease, they would give you the explanation about the food habits, that “You have to take diet only in this particular way” or “You will become good, only when you take this particular diet”. So such things should be done. If such centers are opened, then it will make a lot of difference.', 'Alright. What is the age group of those patients, who come for diabetes? Of age group 40 or 45 to 70 or 80.', 'How about younger people? Younger people are there. But it is very less. We can count around only 5 percent who are under the age of 40.', 'Alright. And what is the reason for getting diabetes mostly for these people? One is hereditary, that means it may be got from the previous generation. The person gets it from there. Those people have 70 percent chance for getting diabetes. Secondly, food habits and also obesity. So, because of obesity, food habits, hereditary and sedentary lifestyle, which involves just keep sitting, not doing any work out, the chance of getting diabetes increases.', 'Generally, what would be the job profile of most of these people? Job profile of most of them is sitting job, those who just keep sitting. Mostly 60 or 70 percent people are like that. Just doing office work or any other sitting job, their life will be stressful. We have seen more of those people. In remaining 30 percent, they might be working or may be even doing exercise. Still they get diabetes. What I meant to say is they might be doing the routine running around, but still because of their hereditary history, they get diabetes.', 'See, I have heard many a times that if we do physical exercise, then diabetes remains in control or it becomes less. Not like it remains in control. Exercises need to be done to keep diabetes under control. Those who already have diabetes have to do exercise to keep diabetes under control.', 'Then how do we differentiate the exercise? Suppose we have every day’s work, and if ladies are doing cleaning of the house and vessels or do cooking... Even if they do work by their own hands, still she must walk for about 20 minutes in 4 to 5 days in a week. She should walk for 20 minutes to 40 minutes.', 'Alright. Suppose if we want to define physical exercise, then how do we define it? When defining physical exercise, first of all walking is the best. Then routine, suppose if you had joined in gym, then follow whatever instructions are given by the gym instructor. Do that depending on your weight and body. They give you exercises depending on how obese you are. Those who are normal or who have a proper body with a proper weight and structure, if they walk 40 to 50 minutes five days in a week, then it is enough. Then there is no need to do more work out. But it is necessary for obese patients to join gym and do other exercises like weight lifting and all. You must do that. So that the weight reduces. Generally, for the ladies or gents, who have an average body and proper weight as per their age, walking 40 to 45 minutes is enough.', 'So, what they do every day is not counted. No, that should not be counted. What I said is over and above that one. If it is a work that is having too much of everyday walking because of your business or work or whatever, like 10 kilometers or so, then it is okay.', 'Then it is okay. If walking for 5 kilometers are being done, then for that person it is okay. Also, those who are having routine work at home, like cleaning of the house, cleaning of vessels, in that not much is done.', 'Suppose when we see the gent’s profile, they use to go from one place to the other place. No doubt that they walk only little and little. Yes, they walk little by little, and that only matters hardly.', 'But they have to walk for the whole day. So, is that considered, or do he need to do that specific 20 minutes jogging? You have to do jogging for 20 minutes, continuously. The other one will be like hardly might walk for 10 steps and then would sit or walk 100 meters and then would sit. So even if we calculate that for all day in a week, then it would be equivalent to hardly one or two days only. If you are walking for 20 or 45 minutes, then it is important to sweat. While walking without sunlight, if you are sweating, then it is called as exercise and your calorie is burned.', 'Many a times what happens is that if we go to a hospital like this, the whole family might be sitting in a room. But there will be having internal fights in between. Like the children might be saying back that “You should not have spoken this”. Sometimes the children might become as friends with the doctors. Then they might tell doctor that “They are doing like this. They are not listening”. So like that sometimes they might speak as harsh to each other. Do such things happen? Such things happen in the case of food habits. I don’t see that in any other things.', 'Among those who come here, do the children listen to their parents? Yes, mostly they listen to them. They don’t create any problem.', 'Alright. Do the patients who come here with diabetes follow the instructions that is been given by you? Like when you say, “Leave this” or “Don’t eat that”. We have printed one book for that. We give them that book and explain about that book that “These are the things that is been written for you in this book. So, you should read it every day and should understand it”. They may not understand it by reading only once, because it is out of course for them. They are non-medical people. So, they won’t understand it immediately that “If you do certain things then diabetes will be reduced or increased. If you eat this, then it would increase. This can or cannot be eaten. This much walking needs to be done. If you get vomiting, fever or loose motion, then you have to stop the medicine. In that case you should not take medicine for diabetes or injections or insulins, if they are going on”. All these things are written in that. But they may not understand it. So, if they read it repeatedly, then they may understand it. So, we give them that book and tell them to read it every day and understand it. Also, we tell them to ask if there is something that they don’t understand. We tell them like that. We give this advice to them and tell them to continue their routine. But once they go home and start their routine, then they don’t pay much attention to it. Mostly this is what happens in the case of diabetes. In diabetes, the patients won’t be having much problem for their body. If you don’t eat or eat something, immediately there won’t be any effect. So, they don’t pay much attention. Those who are aware, won’t have any problem. Those who don’t have awareness at all, how much ever we lecture them…', 'How many such people might be there? Such patients might be about 60 percent.', 'I am asking about the people who don’t listen. Yes, about 70 percent are the ones who don’t follow. They say these things are okay. It keeps happening. We will have to take one tablet extra and have it. This type of mentality is there. Alright.', 'Alright. Do the patients know to read and write? Sometimes such things also will be there. Right now, such things are even less than 5 percent. The children who come with the parents are all educated. They tell that we will read and make them hear that. So that is what happens. So, there is no much of that problem.', 'In the houses where the diabetes patients are there, within the family, do they have any other diseases apart from diabetes? Apart from diabetes, BP problem is more. Heart problem is also more. Diabetes is more. Breathing problem is also more. Breathing problem is there because of problem with lungs or heart. These are seen more because of the habit of smoking. So, these four are there for sure. Diabetes, BP, heart problem and breathing problem. Apart from diabetes, mostly these are seen.', 'So, it is seen in their family as well. Yes, we see this, also in their family.', 'What do they eat mostly in sweets? In sweets routinely…', 'You had said know that they won’t do follow up. So at which point does it break? Where the things use to go wrong? It is broken by the people who can afford to eat fruits frequently like banana, mango, chikoo and all. They eat even if we tell them not to eat. In sweets, they use to have whatever is cooked like Shiro, mango, mango juice and all. So, they eat it. They won’t think like “This should not be eaten”. It is not like that. They would definitely eat. Many a times we came to know that they need it. Every day one sweet is needed for sure. It can be in the afternoon, evening or morning. So, the problem comes here. Another problem is because of the seasonal fruits like banana, mango, chikoo. They also have juices, ice cream and all. They don’t have awareness at all. All these are written in the book. But they follow it hardly for a month, or a week or ten days. After that everything vanishes. After that they don’t pay attention at all. So, they have ice cream. Cooldrinks are also drunk.', 'Alright, then afterwards do they come and tell you? Yes, they tell know.', 'Like I ate these and these things. Yes, they tell that “We are eating”.', 'They don’t feel bad about the thing that they ate. Yes, because those who come with uncontrolled diabetes, their habit is bad. We tell them, still they don’t …', 'is there any way to correct it? The way is how I told you, that awareness centers need to be opened. Then only it will work. Like how gyms are opened, like that an awareness center need to be opened. Then it can be done and can make people aware about diabetes. Secondly, need to make them aware about how to take medicine, like if somebody gets vomiting, loose motion, fever and all. Suppose if somebody has got fever, then he may not be able to eat anything for two days. Then you will have to reduce the dosage of the medicine or if you are not able to eat at all, then you will have to stop the medicine. They don’t know about these things as well. They continue having medicine and get hypoglycemia. Suddenly the sugar comes down, since they are not eating anything, and the medicine is continued. They become unconscious and come here. Brain might get damaged because of that. So, such problems would happen. Many people use to come like this with hypoglycemia, as they are not aware. They don’t know how to control diabetes and what needs to be done, how to take tablets, when to stop tablets, when to start it and all. These things are also important. So, there are two sides of diabetes patients. It may increase or may get controlled, and at the same time the medicine for diabetes will be going on. But because of lack of awareness, it may reduce as well.', 'That means regular glucose monitoring is necessary. Yes, regular monitoring should be done. We always tell them about glucose monitoring, that in every month the monitoring of glucose should be done and have to keep a chart for that. If fever, vomiting, or diarrhea happens then you will have to stop the medicine. You should not take diabetes medicine at that time. But that awareness is very less. Hardly about 10 percent people might be knowing this.', 'Alright. Rest 90 percent of the patients don’t have any idea about it.', 'So how you are monitoring it right now? Right now, once they come here, their glucose is monitored. We have this glucometer over here. With that we use to check every hour or every four hours and give them medicine accordingly. Then it reduces immediately by 25 percent. We give them Dextrose or something like that. Then that gets controlled. But in house mostly we advise everybody to have glucometer. We tell them to keep a glucometer and if they feel like sweating or giddy or unrest, then need to check immediately. And if you are in your senses, then must eat 4 to 5 spoons of sugar or else there is a tablet called Hypotem, then immediately it will be controlled. If the patient is not getting up as the diabetes is lower than 80 or 70, then need to take them to the hospital immediately and have to give them IV glucose. Then it will be recovered. Mostly they get recovered. Those who come immediately within one or two hours, their sugar gets controlled. We give them one pint and keep them here for one day and do monitoring. Over the day we give them glucose with IV. So, it gets controlled. But such patients use to come frequently.', 'Do they come frequently? Per month, 30 patients of hypoglycemia would definitely be there.', 'Okay and are there any repeated patients? Yes, mostly they are repeated and new one keeps adding on. Those who don’t have awareness are also there.', 'But once they come and then when you explain to them, then do they come aginn? Yes, such patients are hardly 10 percent.', 'Those who don’t improve. Those to whom you have explained and still coming repeatedly. Like that there are 10 percent, who are not able to follow or understand in spite of explaining to them. Such patients are 10 percent. Rest all patients are added new, since they don’t have awareness. It happens because of that. Or along with that they might be having CRF kidney diseases. In the patients whose kidneys are not working properly, it reduces as the diabetes medicine are going on, you know. It reduces frequently. So in this case also, such thing happens.', 'Do people buy glucometer at home? Yes, they buy.', 'Most of them? Because the cost of glucometer is not too much. It comes with free strips. So, they buy it. And additional strips are bought at a cost of 300 to 400 rupees for 25 strips.', '25 strips for 300 to 400 rupees? Yes. So, they buy it at home.', 'How much is the cost of the glucometer? You can consider it as 1000 rupees.', '1000? Yes.', 'Alright. Then how about strips? 350 for 25 strips.', 'Alright. So mostly everybody buys it. Yes.', 'Then how many might be there who don’t buy it? Less.', 'Less? About 75 percent people buy it. Only the rest 25 percent don’t buy it. Those 25 percent people who are economically poor and cannot afford, don’t buy it. Rest all buy it. They have no problem.', 'But then do you get solid result with glucometer? Solid result, no problem. There might be a difference of 10 points. But that doesn’t make much difference. If your sugar is 400 and when you were doing it from outside, it gives result as 390, that doesn’t matter. But if your sugar is 300 and your glucometer shows 100 or 150, then it is okay. It makes difference, but by that it doesn’t cause any difference in the treatment.', 'Okay, alright. If your glucometer shows you the sugar as 50, then you have to understand that you have got hypoglycemia and you need treatment immediately or you need sugar. And if your glucometer shows 500 or high, then immediately you have to be admitted, as your sugar is out of control. Or if it shows 400, then immediately you have to consult or change the medication or increase the medicine. It is like that.', 'Alright. Then those who have uncontrollable diabetes might be taking insulin, right? Yes, insulin is there.', 'Mostly how many such patients are there? 25 percent are insulin patients. There are 25 to 30 patients, who are elderly people with chronic disease.', 'Do they take it regularly? Yes.', 'Also, there are many complications in that right? Like you have to take insulin, half an hour before meals and all. It is difficult to explain those things. Also, it is difficult to understand. But now even the patients have started taking those by themselves. Also, even children had started to do the work of giving insulin. They understand, and they give. So, there is no issue in taking insulin. The problem comes for those who is taking it for the first time. (A call comes for Vinod and he picks the call)', 'Also, there are many complications in that right? Like you have to take insulin, half an hour before meals and all. So, everybody takes liberty in this.', 'Okay, everybody takes liberty. So, in a day in which things do they…As you said there are middle-class and lower middle-class. So as per their lifestyle, there would be intake of sugar many a times in a day. So, after you explaining to them, in which things do they stop using sugar and which are the things in which they cannot stop using sugar? First, they take liberty in tea. They take liberty in ice cream and cooldrinks as well. They take liberty in juices and in fruits. Yes, they may not eat sweets, but they take liberty in these things. Those are who don’t know or who cannot control themselves. They say that “I cannot manage without eating mango or having mango juice”. Such patients are seen more in middle class and higher middle class.', 'Then many a times people might decide in front of you itself that “I want to leave everything” Yes, here everybody tells like that. When they start to suffer, they accept and tell that “We will not do this”, “We will eat only those things” or “We will not eat those things”. They accept that and understand as well. But once they go home, it vanishes in 50 or 60 percent people.', 'So, like that everybody decides in front of you, right? Yes, everybody decides like that in front of me as “We will do this way only”.', 'But then they cannot follow. In about 50 percent, it gets followed and in the rest 50 percent, it doesn’t get followed.', 'Then when you advise them to do exercise, is that followed regularly? The advice of exercising or walking are followed by 50 percent and not in the rest 50 percent.', 'Have you seen any patients who are already doing exercises and still they face some problems? And when they come, you might have told them to do exercises and they might have replied that “We are already doing exercises”. Such things use to happen in only 5 percent of patients. We find such things in only 5 percent of patients, like they do exercise and take care of so many things, still they face problems.', 'Then how much do they know about diabetes, at the time when they had visited you and before you told them something about diabetes? Apart from what we tell them, they don’t know anything about diabetes. All knows whatever sir has explained them and understood. Those who has read the book properly and understood it, knows lot of things that “We should not eat these things”,” If we eat this thing, such and such will happen” and all. But these happens only when they are understanding the whole book. Those who have understood about diabetes, they should know what are the reason that would increase the diabetes and what could be the reason to reduce diabetes, what problem can happen by eating what, what are the advantages of exercising, how the calories are burned by doing exercises. Those who have understood all these things won’t be having any issues.', 'But how many such people would be there? Such people are very few.', 'No, what I want to ask you is that suppose somebody has came to you for the first time for the treatment. Yes.', 'So, for him as a layman, what he would be knowing about diabetes? Like whether it happens because of sugar or it comes as hereditary… They only know that by eating sweet, you will get diabetes. They only know this thing. This is the only answer that they have that “Sir, we are not eating sweets. Then how we got diabetes as we are not eating sweets at all”. When we check their history, they say that “They have tea, they have cooldrinks, they are eating ice creams. But by eating that diabetes does not happen”. See, having diabetes is hereditary. A part inside our body called pancreas does not work. If a cell does not work, then by that you get diabetes. When insulin is not produced in your body, diabetes happens. Once you get diabetes, you should not eat sweets. You have to control sugar. You cannot take sugar and should have a sugar free diet. There is no problem, till the time you don’t have diabetes. Everybody has 20 percent chance of getting diabetes. Suppose if I eat and keep sitting all the time, like I keep eating sweet things and don’t burn my calories, then I have 20 percent chance of having diabetes for sure. Those who have history of hereditary, like when mother, father or grandparents are diabetic, or mother and father or brother, sister-in-law, uncle, father’s sister has diabetes, then they have 70 percent chance of having diabetes. For those whose parents have diabetes and have history of hereditary, they their children also have 70 percent chance of having diabetes.', 'So, they have no idea about this. No, they have no idea about this at all.', 'Do they know the symptoms of diabetes? In the symptoms, they know only one thing that the person may go frequently for urinating.', 'Okay, alright. Apart from that mostly nobody knows anything.', 'Alright. Then how about which are the body parts that is been affected by diabetes? No. They don’t know about that at all.', 'Okay, they don’t know at all. Then how about can it be cured or not? Yes, it can be controlled. About that also they don’t know. They only have this idea that in the case of diabetes, once the medicine has been started, then it cannot be stopped. They know only that much. So, they are like “We don’t want to start”. In BP also, it is like that. In diabetes and BP, in both once the medicine is started…But they don’t have knowledge about when the BP is getting high or diabetes is going uncontrolled, so they think that to keep it in control sir has written these many medicines and that must be taken. Actually, it is not like once you had started, it needs to be taken continuously. That awareness is not there.', 'Alright. You came here since 2005, right? Yes.', 'Then you are here for almost 10 years, right? Before my work was only in afternoon timings. I used to come only for TMT and PFT tests. Afterwards, since last year I made it almost full time.', 'Alright. So, you must have observed the trend. Yes, I had observed the trend.', 'Then in the case of diabetes, if we consider the overall area, then do the number of patients who come here has increased or decreased? Among the patients of diabetes, in between there was an increase in the number of patients. But now I feel that it has become stable little bit. There are not many diabetes patients, like how I saw in between. I feel that compared to before it is less. I feel that personally. But otherwise patients do come for diabetes.', 'So, before it had increased? Yes. That has now come to a stable state. And we can say that now there is an increase in the awareness. The young generation had understood that if we don’t do these and these things, then there is a chance to have diabetes. They have understood that to some extent.', 'Alright. Then what system do we have here for data entry? What you mean?', 'Who takes care of patient’s history? There is one which is known as IPD clinical and it is a program of VSS, and the other one is Hospital Management System. It is known as HMS program. These three are there. We manage in that.', 'For the first time when the patient comes, then… Then his name is registered. His registration will be done, which are the medicine that is going on right now will be written, which all medicines give him reaction will be written, which medicine won’t suit him is also written. His address is written, his phone number is taken and the whole details are entered into VSS through data entry. And his contact numbers are taken. After writing all these things his medicine is written like these tests are done and these medicines are given for such and such problems. These are written, and thus the record is maintained.', 'Okay. In the same way, those patients who come in the clinical IPD, when they admit them his number is noted, his registration is done, his address is taken and whatever medicine need to be given are given, the chart for which all medicine he gets reaction is prepared and we give those details to the H&S program where we write the whole history. So, in that everything is included.', 'Alright. How much time is spent? See, when a patient come, then his name, address and phone number is taken. Then you said that his medicine and what are the reaction that he has, such details are taken. So approximately how much time is taken in doing all these? Noting the reactions of medicine is done by sir, when he checks the patient clinically. At that time he does those.', 'Family history and this and that, so lot of time goes. So, the one who do data entry had the complaint that lot of time is gone in deciding and opening tabs as there are 8 to 10 tabs at a time. So, one full proforma has to be kept, that this is the family history, these are the habits, these are the general conditions, like all fitting into one page only. And then you have to just click and no need to open the tabs. You just have to click right choice and enter.', 'Yes, we have changed that now, as everything fits into a single page only. Please take one history letter from us. In that all the histories are written. And then you can keep that proforma ready in one page, then everything will fit in. You keep whatever you need and remove those things which you don’t need.', 'Alright. You said that patient must do the glucose test in every month. In that case, do the patients have to come every month? No. They can test it by using glucometer.', 'Then how do they inform you? They can just write it down and when they come to do the checkups or when they realize or feel that diabetes is coming below 80, then they would get alert immediately. Or if it comes above 300, then also get alerted immediately. Then they come immediately to show by taking an appointment. They have been already informed about that.', 'Alright. But suppose if we design such an application in mobile, as all people might be using mobile, and if diabetes comes between a range like 80-100 or 100-120, then there is no need to come for a visit. In some cases, you would just need to change the medicine, that would be okay. Then if they inform this through phone… They can inform by phone. But the doctor would be busy, you know. So, the treatment cannot be done through phone.', 'Alright. But suppose if we design such an application in mobile, as all people might be using mobile, and if diabetes comes between a range like 80-100 or 100-120, then there is no need to come for a visit. In some cases, you would just need to change the medicine, that would be okay. Then if they inform this through phone… Whatever is your system, it will be updated.', 'It is an application, right? You have already fed all your data into the application. Directly the application itself will give the reply, like do this or don’t do this?', 'Yes, it will write the medication also for you. That is very difficult.', 'Is it difficult? Yes, only highly educated or highly profiled people can only understand. But that can be done…', 'But only a few medicines are required, know? Yes, but it is difficult, especially for middle-class. You can do that for higher class people like those who are high profiled people or highly educated people and those who are aware of these systems. It will work for them. But for others it may not be possible. (Boy is showing the application in the computer)', 'But only a few medicines are required, know? See, this is the patient’s list. In that here is the general data. Patient’s address, communication details like phone number, age, height, weight, all these details are there. After that these are contact details. Now, this is the main part. One is history and the other is status. In status details like smoker, non-smoker, alcoholic, whether family planning is done or is pregnant, due date and all are entered. If we enter the due date the system by itself will notify that “The due date of this person is nearby”. So, you can contact her and say that “From now onwards start taking more care”. We ourselves can give direct notifications. Now in history, suppose there is a history of hypertension… With hypertension can diabetes happen?', 'But only a few medicines are required, know? No. Diabetes is different, and hypertension is different.', 'But only a few medicines are required, know? I mean diabetes and heart diseases are related.', 'But only a few medicines are required, know? Yes.', 'But only a few medicines are required, know? So, we can understand the link by seeing the history, that if somebody have the history of diabetes, then he has the risk of these things. So, we can update him regarding that.', 'But only a few medicines are required, know? Those who have diabetes, can have the problem of stroke. He can have heart disease, kidney problems. There are chances for having all the three for that person.', 'But only a few medicines are required, know? See, here there are both the things, like one is patient’s history and the other one is family history.', 'But only a few medicines are required, know? Both are necessary.', 'But only a few medicines are required, know? In family history if there is diabetes, then there is chance for that patient to have diabetes. So we can explain it to him that be aware beforehand. So, this is the whole system.', 'And we have given cards outside to around 1600 to 2000 members. We have this in whatever plan is going on right now. (Explaining the system to Vinod) These are numbers and these are codes by which they are identified. It is not available with everyone. But some of them have. It also indicates that whether they are above or below poverty line. During tests many a times they were not able to afford it. So whatever discount we can give for them… Yes, we advise that.', 'In this, do you feel that any thing is less, or something needs to be added or something is extra, or something can be done? In this your entire history comes, then these diseases are there, family history and habit also comes, and which medicine give reactions or which medicine you are not supposed to take can be added. So, you can add those allergic details.', 'Yes, allergic details. Another thing is about food habits. You can add that whether the patient is obese or with an average body. So for that you can give dietary advice.', 'That’s right. You can do that.', 'The next thing is, you might have seen that thing with the patients over here. The card that we had given in slums, they are thinking that this is an insurance card. They go to civil hospital and show this and say like “You take this card and do our treatment”. Yes, that will always be there, because their interest is like that. So, it will be there.', 'So, like that here for whichever patients come, whether you have applied such a system which has caused misconceptions later? We have full staff and time. So, if any such misconceptions happen, then we can clear it.', 'But has it happened like that? Can you tell us? May be possible that it hasn’t reached to me, because it might have been sorted out from the lower level itself. For example, if the card is given they will ask “What card is it?” Is it insurance card or like how you said. They would ask that. But we explain to them like, “Write your address, date. Once your card is made, it would be fed into the computer, then with that number your registration will be done in our hospital office. And we enter your number in the computer, then whatever detail are written will be opened in the computer”. We explain in this way to them.', 'Because in that down area we had faced lot of problems. So, if we are seeing how your system is, we will get a little idea about what is the difference between the people over here and in the down area and where it is different. Suppose we want to build a general system, which would address people in all classes, then it should not be of different kinds. It is same for everyone. Only one system is there for everybody.', 'But sometimes it happens so that when we give the cards, the higher middle class will not prefer to take the cards. You don’t have to give card. See, the card is included only in whatever file we make. Then on the top of whatever prescription is given to them, that number comes. That means the registration number. Then we just have to enter the registration number and all the details will open.', 'So, you have to maintain one manual file. Yes, manual file needs to be maintained. We might have details with us. Along with that a manual file will be definitely there. Got it?', 'Yes, I got it. They have their manual file and other details like, for example, what medicine give them reaction, what diseases are there or what are their habits are fed once.', 'Alright, that means you don’t have to ask again and again. We can see that details whenever we open the respective pages, that we have written these habits and all of that person.', 'Okay. That will not be there in his file.', 'So, do you maintain two files? No, only one file is maintained.', 'So, do he have to keep that one? Yes.', 'Will not it be here in the hospital? No. Only the files of those who are admitted will be maintained in the hospital. The files of OPD patients are not maintained here in the hospital.', 'Okay. Where are those data stored? Do you have your own server? Yes.', 'Is it here in the hospital? Yes. It is here in the hospital.', 'Alright. In the case of glucose monitoring, suppose a person don’t have diabetes, then do he also have to monitor glucose?', 'Alright. Monitoring must be done. It should be done at least once in a year.', 'Alright. And suppose somebody has a family history, then?', 'Alright. Then he must do it every year.', 'Alright. He must do?', 'Alright. Yes, he must do. Glucose monitoring is must for those who have hereditary history. He has to do it every year. For those who have diabetes should do four type of tests. They need to do that every year. Like how I said glucose, FBS and PPBS, need to be done every month. And for those whom it remains in control with medicines and there is no problem, have to do it every month. Along with that creatinine test need to be done in every six months or three months. Blood urea test also need to be done in every three months. Also, urinary micro albumin test needs to be done in every six months. All these, even the lipid profile test needs to be done in every year. If a person has diabetes, then they have to do these tests in every year. Those who have diabetes need to monitor BP, also the reports and blood tests are needs to be done in this way. For that, we have one book with us for diabetes. In that all the instructions are written.', 'We use to get those ads, you know, about that Nike thing which you can put on your arms while doing jogging, so that the steps are counted. Yes, BP, it counts steps, how many calories are burned…', 'What is your opinion about that? It doesn’t make much sense. Once you decide that you will walk for 45 minutes or 20 minutes, then that’s enough. Then it doesn’t make much sense in calculating and concentrating on that.', 'Alright. There are also many applications on phone which counts your steps like how much you walked in a whole day. Then what is the use of that? For that initially you can pay attention, that we had burned so much of calorie. If it has been given to you that you must walk for 30 minutes or 35 minutes or 45 minutes, then it is okay. But with that it doesn’t make much difference.', 'But there might be some purpose for it, like why it has been made. It might have been made for that purpose only, that if you walked this much, this much calorie would be burned. But I don’t think that, with those things it will create much difference. Still in public, even there is not much awareness about walking and if you try to apply this with them that you walk these much steps or you walk and burn this much calorie, it will take time even to make it enter their mind.', 'Do you remember anything else? (To Interviewer 2) Okay, thank you so much. Okay. Bye.', 'Do you remember anything else? (To Interviewer 2) Okay, thank you so much. They come to pick from anywhere. Who so ever requires us come here to pick us.', 'Do they drop you back? Either they drop us back or they would give us the fare for coming back.', 'Does the job that you have to do is fixed for you? Nothing is fixed. Nobody is fixed. We have to go there at 9’o clock in the morning and at 5 or 5.30 in the evening, we have to come back.', 'How much is the labor charges per day? Here it is 700 rupees for masonry job.', 'How much is the labor charges per day? Whether this recording will be coming in TV, or you are recording it just like that?', 'Is the money that you are getting for your job is sufficient for you? Yeah, we are getting labor charges. Yes, we get the job and we get enough money to have our food. Whether we get it or not, we have to come here every day. Sometimes, we might get someone who offer us Chutak (the work that is not based on contract) work. Then we would go to his house for doing that work. On that day we tell the contractor that we are not coming today, since we are going for Chutak work today.', 'Is it fixed for them to go with a particular contractor? We are not bounded by anybody. Everyone over here is Chutak people. The situation is very bad for 2 years. What to do? So, people do things like getting into someone’s house and things like that. Or else what to do to run our lives? Something has to be done, right? We would not do something deliberately, right? We are ready to do the labor job. But we should get the work, right? Where should we ask for the job? We come here and stand.', 'Is it fixed for them to go with a particular contractor? Otherwise he will commit suicide. (Jokingly) You stand beside him. (Jokingly. To a boy who is standing there, to show his face in the camera)', 'Do those people trouble you? Many people trouble us. They take us forcefully and then they won’t pay us. They say that “Not today, I will pay you tomorrow”. Now how do we get money from them? See, yesterday one man took me, it may be for doing some job. There was so hot. Also, my leg and hand got fractured.', 'Do the people or the contractor take your money? Yes, sometimes they take our money. We are not paid properly.', 'Do someone takes the commission in between? Does that happen? Yes, many times it use to happen like that. Many people do that. Suppose I want to send this person for some job (he is pointing another labor), I would tell him that “The person will give you 1000 rupees, so out of that you give me 500”. So, I get 500 rupees as commission. Many people do like this.', 'In that case, if we create something by which you get intimation about the job on phone, then would it be beneficial for you? Yes, if such an application is made then it is good.', 'If the phone directly intimates you about the availability of job, then there would not be commission charged in between by anybody. This is very nice. This will be good. There won’t be any commission, right?', 'Will that work? Yes, it will work.', 'You will be intimated about the job, directly through the phone. Yes, it will be done. So, we will be able to send them directly and thus our people will be getting the job as well.', 'So, you will not need to stand like this everyday in search for a job. If we don’t need to search for the job like this and if we are getting our remuneration properly, then we could start our own business.', 'Will it work with everybody? Yes, it will work.', 'Will it work with everybody? Yes, it will work.', 'Will it work with everybody? We have to take responsibility for that. If I am responsible, then I have to take care of that.', 'Suppose if there is a system in phone like which we had shown you, where money transferred through the phone, and so that you don’t have to take cash with you, then will it work? Yes, yes. It will work.', 'But would everybody agree for that? Yes, everybody would agree. We will convince them. You tell me about that. As I understands, I would explain to everyone. Then only it can be done. Chain cannot be created just as easy like that. You have to make the chain stronger.', 'Are there any leaders over here? Where leaders? If you are making us to do something, then you would become a leader. If you make a person like me as a leader, then I would make one more person as a leader. Then one more person would be made as a leader. It would be done in that way. You explain to a few people, then they would explain about it to others.', 'Yes, we cannot go and explain to each and every person. This boy has brought me here. His name is Raju Bhai.', 'Raju Bhai is an important person over here. (jokingly) When will you come back? We come back to home around 7.30.', 'Raju Bhai is an important person over here. (jokingly) When will you come back? It may become 8’o clock as well.', 'Today, at what time you will come back? Today I would be coming back around 7 or 7.30.', 'If I am having any work with you again, then will you meet me? Yes, sure.', 'Can you give me your number?

We all are from the same area.', 'I will call and come. Yes, you come. I will introduce you to everybody.', 'At what time will you become free? You say your timing. Give a call and come. So, we all would be present at that time.', 'At what time will you become free? We stay here on the Tekra itself, at Bhavsar Nagar. If you have any work, you can come there.', 'At what time will you become free? You give me call, then I can come here to pick you up.', 'I will call at night and would come. Yes, so at that time we can speak peacefully and can explain each other properly. Also then, we can explain to everybody.', 'And there would be more things as well. Yes, that can be done. No problem.', 'And there would be more things as well. It entirely depends on our ability. You would become a better and better craftsperson, as you get more and more experience. If you are not paying attention, then you cannot become a good craftsperson. If whatever my father was doing has come to me as hereditary, at least to some extent, it would definitely be there in the son as well.', 'Your father also was doing this job of craftsmanship? Yes, my father also was doing the same thing. My father use to do the job of putting kaap. Have been to Pakad?', 'Yes. In the places like Pakad, Kalupur and Nadiad, my father was doing the job of put the railway kaap. But he has became bankrupt because of his drinking habit. He was not paying attention on expending money. But my father had lot of work and he wiped off everything he gets in drinking.', 'Yes. If my father was not alcoholic, then today what labor job I am doing now, I would not had to do that.', 'Have you changed? In that case, I am clear. What must be my age? Can you guess?', 'Is it 24? No, I am 21 years old. My date of birth is 9/06/94.', 'Do these people come from Ramapir? I don’t use to come on this junction. I have contacts from my home. I used to do the labor job before. Then from everywhere, they use to take my number. And they would contact me directly. So now I am getting sufficient work. Lot of people call me for doing their work. So, if somebody calls me, then I go with them. The labor charge for the craftsperson is around 750 rupees with two times tea.

These people come from different places.', 'But from which place do they come from? They come from different places.', 'But from which place do they come from? They come from any of the village, as there are 52 villages in Ahmedabad.', 'But from which place do they come from? Somebody might be from Bharwad, somebody might be from Khatiawadi, somebody might be from Bhasvada.', 'Not like that. Over here, where do they stay? I don’t know about the place over here, of anybody.', 'How many people might be here who is coming from Ramapir? That might be around 55 people. But right now, the public is less. But if you are coming at 8.30 in the morning, then you can see a lot of public. See, when there is a new moon day, or coconut day or Raksha Bhandhan, at that as well, like during festivals as well, people use to gather at this corner.', 'That means it is like on daily basis. Yes, it is on daily basis.', 'Do everybody goes for job? Yes, job needs to be done, right?', 'Do every contractor takes the number? It is the wish and will of the contractor. If the person is doing his job properly, then only he will take his number. Otherwise, the contractor will not take his number. He will change the person then.', 'So that they would do their job nicely. Yes.', 'Then how about the other people? Don’t they work properly? They do the work. But then it depends on each person. Those who are good will get their job by sitting at home.', 'Approximately, how many people might be coming here? Around 300 or 400 might be coming.', 'But now here, there might be around 1000 people. (showing the place and telling) Still there is more at that side. Sometimes there would be more public.', 'Do everybody get job over here? Everybody may not get job to do. Mostly half of them do not get work.', 'Are you educated? Yes, I have passed 10th. During my 10th standard, I had learned the job of doing masonry work. It was not possible for me to do study so much and then search for job and earn money for living. That was not up to my capacity. That’s why I had left my studies and settled in this business. Okay, bye. Will meet again.

Since I am alone, the lady cannot bring work only for me. So I have left embroidery and I am doing this work. Again, if I am getting the work of doing embroidery, I will do that.', 'So you know embroidery? Yes, I know the embroidery', 'Right now many people do not know embroidery.

I have studied less, my education is less, I have studied only till 8th standard, but...', 'You have studied till 8th class? Yes.', 'Very good. I am less educated.

You go to the civil and your checkups will be done from there. And every month you have to take the medicines”. So, I went there and showed the chit to the doctor. The doctor has gone through that and he did the checkup. He wrote the medicines for me. Now I use to go in every month and get the medicines from there.', 'Alright, so you bring medicines and would have the medicines. For your husband, as he is sick, do you cook separate food for him or only whatever cooked in the house is given to him? No, we don’t keep such differentiation.', 'No not like that.

Boys like to see cartoons. Everybody likes TV.', 'In your neighborhood, do everybody talk to each other? You are here, but they all are free, right? Yes, those whose families are at home, are free.', 'Then do those people have any problems or anything like that? And if they have, to whom do they talk to? No.', 'There is nobody like that? If some have some problem, then they would talk about that in their family.', 'See, yesterday when I was talking to one lady, she said that in her house, if there is any problem, then she would talk to Disha Ben in the community center. So like that, in your house if there is any problems, then do you talk to somebody outside the house? Yes, we talk to somebody outside. Also we give advice as well.', 'Do you give advice also? Yes, we tell them that “There is a center over there, you can go there and if you don’t know how to go there, we will take you”. I take them myself as well. Like that we help each other.', 'You do, right? Yes, I would help, but I don’t know about others, whether they are helping or not?', 'Does your husband’s brother or any other relatives stay over here? Yes, he stays here.', 'Is he staying close by? Yes, he stays close by. He stays here only. I am staying little far, near the Chandrabhaga shore and my husband’s brother is staying over here. He is doing tailoring work.', 'Is he doing tailoring work? Do you go to meet him? Or do you go to their home for a visit? No, we don’t get along.', 'Okay, you don’t get along? No.', 'Okay.

For me, most favorite is my eldest son.', 'Eldest son? Yes, if we tell him something or how much ever we beat him, still after some time like after 5 minutes, he will come and hug. Like that everyone is my favorite, as they are my children. But he is the most affectionate one.', 'Yes, that is true. Because if there is anything, like if we give him a slap or else his father gives him a slap, as he has played some mischief, then after 5 minutes, they would come back to the same as they were. They don’t take it to the heart thinking that “My father has beaten me” or something like that. They will not think that way.', 'Small children will be mischievous only. Yes. All are mischievous. They are two brothers and so they are always fighting. During fighting they only do mischiefs. I use to listen, to whatever they do. But now I am here, and their father is there at home. Mostly, he would have been slept. You cannot go out in so much of heat. But my daughter would be playing there and will come back only at 6’ o clock. I go from here by only 5’o clock.', 'Is there anyone for whom you have to take care? No.', 'No? Will they do everything on their own? Yes.', 'Do they take care of you? These children only takes care of me. If there is any problem for my legs, they will say like “Mummy, should I press legs for you?”.', 'Who tells that? My children.', 'Who? The elder one? Yes. My son who is 12 years old, he tells. He would ask “Mummy should I press your hands?” or “Should I press your head for you?”. Then I would tell, “No, my son. I don’t have any problem”. Also, he would ask me that, “What happened? Why are you worried so much?”. Then I tell them that nothing is there. So, he tells me such things.', 'So, they are understanding everything. Then only they will take care. Daughter is also there, but she is not like that. My daughter is a bit short tempered. If there is something, she would start crying. This brothers and sister won’t get along well with each other. It is like that. They don’t get along.', 'Alright. She does lot of trouble for having food as well.', 'Your daughter? She is like that, because the girl’s taste of tongue would be very strong. Yes, but she is thin, like this.', 'If you tell them something, will they listen to you? Everyone will listen.', 'Not like that. Would they argue with you? Yes, they would argue. They are boys, so they would do. When both of them are arguing and when I shout at one of them, they would say that “You are not telling him, why are you only telling me?”. When I tell the second person he would also say, “You are not telling her. Why are you telling me?”. Then whom should I tell.', 'Alright, but they would listen to you. Yes, they would listen to me.', 'Also, they might be insisting for few things, right? May be for silly things. Yes, they sometimes insist as well. After all, they are children, right?', 'But then, after that when you are explaining to them, would they listen to you? Yes, when we explain to them, they will listen to me. Like when we say, “My son, not today. I will buy that for you after two days”, then they would say, “Okay alright”. But, then he would remember and after two days, he would tell me, “Mummy! You told me that you will buy it today. Then why didn’t you buy it? I want it today, I want it today”.', 'They are very smart, right? The most mischievous is my Sumith. His name is Sumith.', 'Sumith, is he the elder one? Yes, he is the elder one. But he is in the middle.', 'He is the smartest of all, right? Yes, he is smart. He is smart in studies and he is smart in playing mischiefs as well. He is very mischievous.', 'Do they go out at night or are they not supposed to go out during night? No. They roam in the Chaul. After having food, people would be watching TV or mobile. Nowadays, people like mobile. If they get somebody’s mobile, they would watch pictures like cartoons. They will see cartoons, but no other mischiefs. Then they would eat and sleep and would get up in the morning.', 'You must be giving them advices, right? Like you should take care of your studies and all? Do they like to go to school? Yes, they go to school.', 'But, do they like to go to school? Yes, yes. Everybody likes to go to school. My youngest son gets up in the morning, brushes, finishes all his work, finish his bath and then he wakes me up.', 'Is it like that? Yes. They would say, “Mummy now you get up, I am ready now”. He would take bath on his own, wear his clothes, shoes and socks and everything. After that he tells me, “Mother, get up, please make breakfast for me”.', 'Very nice. So, you don’t have to force or explain to them much, right? No. My elder son Sumith is like, even if he doesn’t do breakfast, as his time rings, he will take bath, dresses up, gets ready and goes.', 'What is the name of your younger son? Shubam. My younger son’s name is Shubam, second one is Sumith and the eldest one is my daughter Ranjana. She is also like that in her studies. If she is angry or if she has been offended, then she will not eat. She will take bath, combs her hair, wears her dresses on her own and she will go. She will take her bicycle and go.', 'Has it happened any time, that they have not listened to you? Like you have told something to them, but they have not listened. Yes, it use to happen sometimes, like if we tell something they won’t listen.', 'For what matters it happens? Or on what incident it happens? Suppose they have to go out with somebody, so I tell that “My child there is so much of sun and heat outside, so you don’t go”. Then he would not listen, he would go. And then when he come back, he would have fallen sick. Like that he went one day beyond the Ashram to play football, then when he came in the evening… Even in abhayghat, there is an abhayghat over here. Once he went there in the afternoon. We have told him that, “Son, you don’t go”. Then he said that, “No mother, I will go”. Even he had put the cap and went. Still, when he came back, he said “Mummy, my head is aching”.', 'Yes, it happens in the heat. What to do? Where should we go at night to buy medicines? Then, in the morning I went to the center and brought medicines and gave him. If we have any problem, like if my son, my children or myself is having any problem, I get medicines from the center, as that medicine is very effective. Even if there is cold or cough, I get medicines from center. Only one day we would have the medicine and  next day we become alright.', 'Then, when the doctors give medicines, they might be giving as a course, like to take it for one week or like that. It would be three days course.', 'Three days course? Then do you complete that course? Yes, we complete that course.', 'From where I take medicines, it is been given for a week. If I become alright in two days, I would stop taking medicines. Does it happen in your case? Yes, it is there like that. My Sumith is like that. He does like that, but then I advise him that “My son, whatever course has been told to you by madam, you must complete that course. Because if the problem erupts again to you, then it would cause problem for me as well”.', 'Then, does he complete that course? Yes, then he completes that course. My daughter is there, the elder one, she does lot of tantrums for eating medicines. Whenever I bring medicines for her, she will have it only for one day and from the second day she will not have medicines at all.', 'She doesn’t have medicines like that? No, not at all. She says, “I don’t want to have it now, as I have become alright”.', 'Then what do you do to convince her? What can I do? If she is a small child, then we can mix it in a spoon and make her drink. She is now big. Then how do I explain to her. She says “No, I have become alright”.', 'Okay, does she then becomes alright? Yes, she becomes alright.', 'Is there anybody to whom you can talk about, if you have any worries. Because you cannot talk everything to your children, right? I talk to their father.', 'You talk to their father? Yes, I feel sometimes offended as well. I feel angry also. So many days had passed by and so much of price rise is there. And in a house as many people are there, that many earning people are needed. And right now, in my house my husband goes for work hardly one or two days and he stays at home for almost 8 days. At that time, I feel little angry sometimes.', 'Yes, but it is natural. Then, I speak out. But then again, I feel that I shouldn’t have spoken to him like that. Because if he does not have work, then where will we go to do the work. I repent from inside, but I cannot tell him that. And when my angers cool down, I make him sit and explain to him that, “We have 3 children. For them we should give good food, every day’s bath, clothes, cleanliness and all. We can do all that, only if we have money. If we don’t have money, then how can we manage? You are saying that, there is no work. But then, if there is no work, then how will it do? How the house will run?”.', 'That is right. We have to give education to our children. We only have to do those things. With whatever problems we are having now, our body is also slowly becoming old.', 'Yes, age is increasing. Yes. The age is increasing. So, right now if we are saving money, it will be useful for us.', 'Does he agree to whatever you say? He agrees, but then he asks, “Where do I go?”.', 'That means you have to keep explaining to him after few days? Yes, I have to keep explaining to him.', 'Does anybody have any addiction in the house? Yes. My husband has addiction of beedi.', 'Is it beedi? Doesn’t he drink alcohol? No, he doesn’t drink alcohol.', 'That is good. Is there anybody other than your family member, who is important in your life? Like a person who is from outside the family and who is important and with whom you can talk whole heartedly, like if you any worries or if you have worries about your children. No, I don’t tell to anybody.', 'To nobody? You keep everything within yourself? Yes.', 'But somebody, that is required, right? Yes, somebody like that is required. If I tell something to that person, then that person should be able to understand and give us the strength by saying that, “You don’t worry. I am with you. Let anything happen. And if your situation is bad, I will help you out”. Such person should be there. Otherwise what is the use of telling? We have to solve our problems by on our own. So, there is nobody like that.', 'Nobody like that? Any friend of yours or here all the sisters are there or anybody from community center? In the community center, there is Jyotsna Ben. If I have any problem or if there is any situation like that, then I tell Jyotsna Ben.', 'Do you talk to her? Yes. I tell her that this is the situation in my house and she has always stood by me. So whatever problems I have, I tell her and nobody else.', 'Is there anybody to whom you will never say ‘No’ for any work? Like if that person has told something to you, then you can never say ‘No’ to especially to that person. Yeah, because of that my children also shouts at me. If somebody comes for something, then I will help out that person or else if some work needs to be done for them, then I will do that. If somebody comes and ask me that “You give me your fans, I will return in two days”, then that person takes one month to return that fan. Still I give them such things. The opposite person’s work needs to be done and that person should not feel hurt.', 'That means you cannot say ‘No’ to anybody like that , right? Yes.', 'Will not you say “No” to anybody? No, I will not say “No”. If somebody comes to ask me money, they would say, “Madhu Ben, can you give me some money? I will return it to you. Then even if I am in need of money, I would give it to that person.', 'You will give it away? Will not you say ‘No’ to anybody? No, I will give it to that person. I will not say ‘No’. Only if I know that the person is such, then I would say “No”, like suppose that person say that, “I will return in two days” and if they takes a month, then I cannot manage.', 'Then you would say ‘No’. Yes, then I have to say “No”.', 'Alright. Why? Because you are managing your work. And how I know about the constrain situation, you also know it. In the same way you also might understand, how this lady would have given me the money and because of that my work has been solved.', 'Is it like you are not saying “No” to that person, as that person is returning the money to you on time? Yes.', 'Do this people might be staying nearby to you? Yes, they might be staying next to us.', 'Will they be your neighbors? Yes.', 'Then who is the person, who will not say “No” to you? Nobody says “No” to me.', 'Nobody will say “No” to you? Yes, I am true to my words.', 'Yes, then everybody knows that, right? Yes, we know people. If there is anything, then I would ask them that “Will you give me this much money, then I will return to you within these many days”. There is one shop near our house, a TV shop.', 'TV shop? That means they do TV repairing and all those work works. One boy is there, he gives me money as many times as I ask from him.', 'He will never say “No” to you? No, he has never said “No” to me and when I get money in my house, I give it back to him. Day before yesterday itself, I had given him 500 rupees back which I had taken from him. I asked him that, “Please give me some money, because I have to bring medicines for my husband” and when we have got money, I returned back that 500 rupees to that boy.', 'Alright. So, are there many people like that or there are only a few people on whom you can put your trust on? There are only a few people. Nowadays, you cannot trust anybody.', 'Yeah, there is not much trust. Is it possible to trust? You can’t trust. Right now, the time is like that. In the case of trust, it is like if we trust somebody, then within my heart I am trusting that person. But how could I know that what is going on in your mind? I will not be having any idea about what you want to do with me. There are some ladies to whom if we had given the money, they will say like, “Did I ask you to give the money? Why did you give me the money?”.', 'Do they say like that? Yes, toward our side of Chaul, it is like that. If we have helped somebody to ease their work, as they might have said me that, “If you give me the money, I will return it back to you”. But I will give the money saying that, “First, get your work done and afterwards only you return it to me”. Then when you go to ask the money back, they would say like, “Why did you give, did I ask to you?”. So, then the trust gets broken.', 'Yes, the trust is broken. Then like how you said, how many such good people are there? There are only a very few people like that.', 'Only few? As you said, one is this TV person. Yes, as many times I have asked him for money, he has given to me. Also if I have told him “One week”, then definitely I will return the money in a week itself.', 'Is there anybody who is fat or thin in your house? Are your children fat? I am the fattest among the all.', 'Are you the fattest from all? Yes, everybody is thin in my house. My husband is thin, and my children are thin.', 'Then what is the reason for that? How do I know? I don’t know that.', 'Do they do a lot of running around? Yes, they do a lot of running around. But I don’t know why. But I am the fattest of all. Before I was thin, but I don’t know how I have become fat now.', 'How is it? Do yourself feel that you are fat? Yes, I feel so and everybody tells that.', 'Not like everybody tells. What you feel? No, what I feel is more than before, right now my body is good and better.', 'It is better, right? That is right. My Ranjana tells me that, “Mummy I have been told from the Ashram that in our house mother’s body is better than anybody else in the house”.', 'So they tells now, alright. All my other children are thin.', 'How many times do you have tea? Two times. But right now, in the heat I don’t drink tea in the evening. But I need it in everyday morning.', 'Do you use sugar when you are cooking food? Sugar? I don’t use. But my children’s father, that means my husband uses.', 'That means you put sugar? In which items do you add sugar? In food, when dal rice is there, we add sugar in that and have it. And if the children don’t like that, then they would have it by adding ghee.', 'Yes, ghee and sugar. They mix it and eat, right? Yes, they have it with ghee and sugar. Also, they would have roti by putting either oil, ghee or sugar. Or else if we get the jaggery, then they eat that.', 'Do they eat jaggery? Like jaggery and ghee, and not sugar? So they would use ghee also, right? Yes, and sugar will be there in the juices also, right? They drink juices as well.', 'Can you do without sugar? No, it will not do.', 'Do you feel it as bland? Yes. It tastes bland, a little has to be there, right?', 'If somebody tells you to leave the sugar, then can you leave it or not? No.', 'Not at all? No, we have used to that. That’s why. Tea also will not be drunk without sugar. Also, if we drink coffee, it cannot be had without sugar.', 'Don’t you feel like if you are stopping having sugar, then it will benefit your body? Yes, I feel so. From here also, the sisters have told me many times like that. But we have got that habit and because of that, it will not do.', 'Which are the sweet things that you can leave or isn’t there a single thing like that? Like suppose if it is tea, then we make tea, but we can drink tea without sugar as well. So, like that which are the things that is made using sugar, that you can leave? Without sugar! We are not having anything else using sugar. We use sugar only in tea.', 'And that you cannot leave? No.', 'Okay, then how many times you drink tea? I drink tea only once, and that also in the morning.', 'Okay in the morning. In a whole day, what are the other things you eat which has sugar? Nothing.', 'No? You want it spicy? Yes, I need it like that. But my husband eats it with sugar.', 'Do you make anything sweet in the house or no? Yes.', 'What types of things do you make? Dal, rice, vegetable.', 'No, no. Sweet things. In sweet things, we have Shiro, but it is not eaten every day.', 'Not every day, sometimes only, right? Yes, sometimes only, like weekly once or in 10 days or 15 days once we make.', 'Is there anybody over here, who believe that if we have skipped sugar, then it is good for our body? Yes,\\xa0the sister tells us like that.', 'How much good it will be for you?\\xa0 How much good it will do?  Does it give benefits if you leave those things? Those who have problems with sugar, for them if their living sugar it is good.', 'Is it\\xa0good for them? Yes.', 'Because of BP, has the doctor asked you to leave anything?\\xa0 Like you should not eat a particular thing or to keep curtailments. No, I have just been told to eat less salt and less oil.', 'Okay, salt. So, did you reduce it? Yes, I reduced', 'As you have BP problem, do the doctor told anything like that to you?

When you are cooking… I saw many families, where the ladies know that in a particular vegetable you will get so many vitamins and so much fiber would be there and so you have to make fibrous food and all. Such things are there. So many people cook after knowing such things and they will not be giving too much of calories to their children. Then do you take such care? Yes, we take such care.

No, not recently with god’s grace. But around six months back my daughter had very a strong effect of jaundice, my younger daughter. Once we had sent her to my mother’s place. So, at that time she had little, little pain in her stomach. So, mother and all felt that she is having stomach pain and so they brought medicines. It was becoming alright for some time and when the medicine was stopped, she was vomiting. Then I brought her here at Ahmedabad and shown her to a good doctor. Then he told that she is having very high jaundice, then I got all her test reports immediately, and then medicines were started.', 'Did you had to admit her? Yes.', 'In the clinic?

Sugarcane juice?', 'What are the cares that are to be taken? Sugarcane juice or we just gave the sugarcane just to chew, and then it made lot of difference to her. Medicines did not help much and afterwards we didn’t had to get medicines as well. Also, chana, those yellow chana.', 'Yes. Yes, I had started chana like how everybody suggested. Then in her food, neither fried nor even oil were to be given to her. If she wanted to eat vegetable, then I had added it in water and cooked it with turmeric and salt. So, like that I did.', 'Right. That means you had taken a lot of care. For how long you had to take that much of care for her? It was more than a month, almost one and half months. Only after that the jaundice started improving.', 'Then she must have taken medicines also, right? She was taking medicines, but everybody said that, “Too much of medicine is not good for jaundice, so you continue these things you are doing”.', 'Then in house normally if somebody gets cold or fever, then do you take medicines or you don’t take? No, we take medicines like that.', 'Do you take? Yes.', 'Then do you complete the whole course or no? We complete the course.', 'For me it is like that, if I am given medicines for 15 days, once I become alright in between, I stop it. Because I get fed up, since every day I have to remember and take it. No, for us we take, we complete the course.

It is just before 3 to 4 months.', '3 to 4 months back? Yes.', 'Then does she take care till now? Or when she goes out, would she eat some fried things or like that? Still we don’t give her outside food. We don’t give her much. If she wants something from outside, then we don’t give her. Because we cannot predict about jaundice. If she eats outside, it may re-bounce at any time.', 'But she is young, right? How old is she, you said? She is eight years old.', 'Then she must be making tantrums, right? Yes, she does.', 'She must be telling that she wants to eat that or something? Yes, for food, she does.

Yes.', 'Do they teach them in the school that these are the thing which are good for our health and then they would come home and tell that, “Mummy we should not eat this, or we should do this”. So, like that till now what are the things they had told as they are taught. Yes, they do tell. After this happened, in between she had a little fever.

Then she would come home and tell.', 'So, teacher explains to her? Yes, teacher explains. She said that teacher told that, “Tell your mother to give me only this kind of food, light food like dal rice, dal roti such things”. In jaundice you cannot give roti as well. Aunty, we were told to not to give roti also (she tells another lady). She had such a jaundice that we got tired with admitting her. She was given drips also. I use to bring her here to Poonam and she became alright.', 'God’s grace. Yes.', 'But jaundice gets cured, right? It is not an issue.

In the evening playing time, they should play and have to go for tuition at the respective time for tuition. So at there it is compulsory to do like that. So they have a little bit of your fear. If I go a little further from that, then the teacher will shout at me. Right now, he has come for vacation. Still he has the fear inside, thinking that “When I go to school, then if my mother says something, then the teacher will shout at me”.

What I am asking is, is many a time there would be problems in the house, and we cannot tell it to our husband or children. As they are small, we cannot tell them.

So, I had paid that. I had brought oil cans. I had paid that as well.', 'Alright. That is good.', 'Alright. Yeah, it is very good. Those people would not be coming home then.', 'Alright. Yes, nobody would come to ask for money, right?', 'Alright. Yes.', 'I have seen in Delhi that… Did you understand what I spoke to this lady?', 'We understood only very little. I had just started the topic, so that you can understand.', 'We understood little by little. These people get loan from here. Suppose they had taken a loan of 10000, alright? Now they have opened their account over here and they would pay 300 rupees per month into that.', 'Loan means, how much loan do they get? Say around 10000. It will not be a big amount.

Those self-helping group. Yes.', 'So that might be like 3 or 4 ladies gathered together and done, right? Yes. No, they get loan from the Trust as well. The Trust people also give them loan. Now, this lady had said that she had brought oil can, so they have to pay 200 rupees per month. So, 200 rupees is not too hard for them. And for them it is like, suppose there are 50 ladies together, and if each one gives 50, then getting around 5000 is easy for them. So, 5000 came in hand, right? In Trust, what is happening is that, you would know that if you had done your graduation, then you will get a lot of help from Trust. And if you don’t know, the Trust belongs to Ananthi Ben’s son in law.', 'Okay. They get help from others, also they help as well. They have made so many toilets for ladies, by taking 500 or 1000 rupees only. If there is any problem, then these people would help that person as well.', 'Have you installed the dish of Airtel?

People from out of the country as well comes over here.', 'People comes from out of the country? We are working with them only. Yes. We sit with them, we help them.', 'We are also working with them. I saw this in Delhi, that those who don’t have a bank account transfer money through phone. They send money to their villages like that. Yes, it is there in Vodafone.', 'Yes, it is there in Vodafone, like M-pesa. So, are the people over here using it? Those who are educated would be using it.', 'Okay. Do those who are educated do the money transfer? And if you tell somebody, then will they do? Yes, everybody is learning and studying. It is not like that.', 'So, you have to sit and explain to them, right? Yes, you have to inform them and explain them.', 'Yes, like it is been done in this way. You have to tell them that, “You can do it from your house and you can do it from anywhere”. Suppose this is my shop, and I am doing accounting on Vodafone.', 'Are you using it on Vodafone? No, no. I am just giving an example.', 'Yes, that’s right. How you are doing? (A man comes on bike and asking the Interviewers) Was it a good experience over here?', 'Yes. Only two more days are pending.

Do you know?', 'Poha from rice? You haven’t eaten it before?', 'Okay, okay. We call it as Poha.', 'I understood what you are saying. But I am not able to remember what it is called.

I don’t know about that properly.', 'Yes, now suppose if we are teaching about that to all of the ladies over here, like how to operate it… Yes, yes. Then that’s it. Nowadays everyone is having phone.', 'Yes, mobile is there with everybody. Those who are uneducated as well, can dial the number through the mobile phone.', 'Yes. This one is also by using number. So, they can do if we teach them, right? Then it will be done.', 'Okay. Suppose if they are paying you through phone, then will you take? Yes, if they pay, I will take.', 'Instead of cash, if they give you through phone… See, they should get the proper information, like “I have deducted money from here and had transferred to that particular place”. They should have enough confidence, as money is such a thing.', 'Yes, in the matter of money, trust doesn’t come easily. Yes.', 'So, we need to gain their trust. Right now, there is no trust. In the case of money, there is no trust. Right now, you have come here and is standing here. But if you ask me like, “Give me 50 rupees”, then I will have to think at least 10 times.', 'Yeah, that is true. If you are going to the Trust, you will be getting more information from there.', 'What are the other things that these ladies buy from here? One is vegetables. Which vegetables do they buy? One lady bought flower.', 'Cauliflower? Yes. In Delhi, is there this kind of hutments? And how the Delhi government is helping that kind of people?', 'In the case of the government, it is the same everywhere. Like how it is in Gujarat. In Gujarat it is good.', 'In Gujarat it is a little better. I have seen that. Suppose if this kind of population is there, I don’t know, here at least Manav Sadhna is there. What I have seen in Delhi, as I have come there once or twice. How much safety is there in Gujarat, I haven’t seen that much anywhere. I am even born in Gujarat. So how much ever safety is there in Gujarat, including ladies, it is not there in anywhere else.', 'Yes, yes. Even I have noticed this thing. There, the crime rate is very high. Here the crime is very less. There, the ladies will not be able to go out at night. In Delhi, the ladies cannot go out at night 12’o clock. Like suppose if you have a girlfriend, then you would not be taking her out during night. It is like that.', 'Yes, that is right. Over here, in the night, even till 2’o clock, the street food market will be on. Even at 12’o clock in the night. You might have roamed everywhere, right? Have you roamed about? Or have you directly come over here?', 'No, no. I came to here only. It is been just two weeks for me. Only two weeks?', 'Yes. You might have seen out of India as well, right?', 'I have not seen much. Only a little. Today morning, I had gone to Akbar Nagar. There, people use to gather, right? Here there is one BRT bus. If you take a ticket, then it will take you to everywhere in Ahmedabad.', 'Okay, okay. So, you can see everywhere, everything. And you would get all the details.', 'I wanted to understand more about this particular community. All these people have Aadhar card.', 'Do everybody has Aadhar card? They are always ready for these kinds of things. If there is any government work, they are always ready.', 'Okay, so they are ready for government things. Yes, because if they wanted to take some loan or something like that, then it would be useful.', 'So they have trust on the government’s work. Yes.', 'Here the government is working as well. See, what is happening is, most of the people who are working in Anganwadi are ladies. The thing is that, they are mostly of the same caste. So, while talking to them, if there is somebody from their own community, then it would be better.', 'Okay, so they want somebody of their own. Yes, because if somebody from outside is coming and explaining to them, then they would not understand it properly.', 'That is correct. If our own people is explaining to us, then we would understand it in a better way. Also they might be giving a salary of 4000 to 5000 to those ladies in Anganwadi.', 'Okay,\\xa0so whatever the government is doing is like appointing teachers in Anganwadi and all… They also give food to small children.', 'Yes. Over here you had seen this kind of population, right? So people like that is there in other places of Ahmedabad as well. But whatever facilities has been provided in the Anganwadi over here, I haven’t seen anything like that anywhere else. Over here, the facilities are really good. My two children are also studying over here.', 'Okay. Like that they are studying privately, but I also sent them for tuition as well. Over here, the tuition is very good.', 'In Manav Sadhna, the tuition is very good? Yes.', 'Wow. Nice. Here there is this society. Their children are studying in English medium.', 'Really, are they studying in English medium? Here also they are there. Here also they are there. (pointing the areas and telling) Different names have been given for each. This is called as Jeevan Sthithi Seva Trust. And that one is Manav Sadhna. Manav Sadhna is very big.', 'Yes. Is it much better over here nowadays? Then how was it before? Before, there were many problems. Now, it has become much better.', 'So, the efforts have been done by the government and Manav Sadhna as well. Also, the government has started so many funds. So, the population will get benefit, right? They know that they are having so much benefits from the government. So, they will take those benefits.', 'What kind of jobs have been doing by these people? They work in Torrent.', 'Job in Torrent? Is it that electrical work? Here many times there occurs the problem in giving changes. So instead of taking changes, they would take things like milk, spinach or something like that. If we keep the account pending, then we may not remember. So, it is better to give them something like milk, spinach, etc.', 'If you are doing these things using mobile, then you will not need to do all these things. Yes, in that we will not need to give any change.', 'Yes, you will not be needing change, when doing PayTM. In that case, if I am starting that in my place, then within no time the public should get the confidence that they will receive their money. If it is done, once or twice, then public will have trust.', 'Yes, if once or twice we are explaining to them, then they will have trust. I want details of your PayTM.', 'I am volunteering. So, I wanted to ask you about a few things. Do the people over here buy the ration on a daily basis? Yes, they buy on daily basis.', 'Okay, on daily basis. Yes, every day.', 'Okay, mostly what do they eat? They eat only these vegetables.', 'Which is the vegetable that has been mostly eaten? They eat all these vegetables every day. We bring here only those vegetables which they would have.', 'Okay, then how much vegetable do you bring in every day? As per the commodity. Like 2 or 2 and half kilo. And if I need more, then I would make it 5 kilos. And if it is expensive, then I would bring 2 kilos.', 'What is this? It is cluster beans.', 'Okay, cluster beans. As per the rate, like now if it is of cheaper rate, then we bring that more.', 'Okay, so right the cluster beans are more. Right now, it is season for this one.', 'Is it now the season for this one? Yes, now the people eat this one more.', 'Okay, do they buy oil from you? Customer buys as per their wish. Some people might buy from here, or else some people might buy from that front shop. Some people might bring a full can or somebody might take a bottle.', 'Which oil would they buy? Cottonseed oil.', 'Cottonseed oil? Which is that oil? Is there a small bottle of that one with you? No, we keep it just for retail sale. There is no bottle for that.', 'Is that the mustard oil? (showing another oil) This one is groundnut oil.', 'I think that the people over here have so much of tea, right? So, tea leaves also might be sold very much? Yes. Over here, tea is being sold out well.']\n"

      "['The problem here is mothers don’t have time to take care of kids. So what they do is they give one rupee in hands of kids, because they want to go out for work or do household work. So what they do is they give one rupee to kids and kids buy those one rupee packet of Mamri and Bhungla and eat it. They are very dangerous and the colors used in that are very harmful. Because of that the kids do not get nutrition. Also they eat pepsi, etc. Mothers don’t have time to cook food and feed them. Because of that kids remain malnutritional. They have lot of superstitions like if a child fall sick, they would go to the Bhuva and do Dhora Dhaga, and will not take them to dispensary. Therefore this malnutriotion is seen at high rate in the kids. Because of anganwadi there has come lot of difference. They have came out little from these superstitions and understood that if a child fall sick or if we fall sick, we should take them to dispensary. When we say them, they become immediately ready.', 'For these people, they have roti and Sabji only. In the morning with tea they fry roti. Who so ever wants to eat will eat , otherwise have only tea. Then the kids will have roti and Sabji and in the evening also they have roti and Sabji.', 'Yes, eating is done. But it is not like he is my son and I have to make him eat. If he wants to eat , he will eat. Otherwise it is okay. In our anganwadi there is lot of importance given to eating food. So when a child comes in the morning till 2’O clock , in morning we give Shira and Rab, then we give Matru Mandal snack. Then at around 1.30 or 2.00 we have another snack from Purak Poshan and we make that. They eat that. So then after going home a child doesn’t not eat. Then in the evening if he wants to eat he eats, otherwise he would use money to buy packet snacks from the road side shops and eat.', 'They are not aware that if we eat a particular thing we get a particular kind of nutrient. Whatever is available they would cook. Sometimes they don’t have money for Sabji also. Then they would eat chilli and Rotlo. Or they would eat just fried roti only.', 'Sometimes they have tensions, sometimes they don’t have money or food, sometimes problems with relatives. These could be the reasons.', 'We conduct Matha meeting every month. We call mothers of malnutritional kids and explain them how to take care of those kids like how to feed them or what to give in their food or if the child is not able to eat more at a time, then feed them every one hour, etc. Like this, first of every month we do meetings with mothers and talk to them.', 'Yes, they eat lot of oily food. For their Sabji, there will be a layer of oil floating on top of the Sabji. We don’t make Sabji like that. On top of that they pour raw oil in Sabji for the kids, so they don’t find it spicy.', 'No, if we make some sweet and give them, they would not eat. We have to force them to eat. If we give them spicy food, the kids would eat.', 'Here they have eaten spicy food right from the beginning, so they can eat. Sometimes when we see their food, we feel like how can a child eat such a spicy food. But child eats.', 'They will not at all eat bland food. They want spicy food. They grind and make masala of the spices and then they make Sabji.', 'Yes, it has to be tasty, otherwise it won’t do.', 'Yes, they say we don’t like the taste. Because they say we have only roti and Sabji to eat. So we like spicy only. They don’t eat bland food. They say our children also would not eat such bland food.', 'No, it’s not like that.', 'They have knowledge because when we do meeting we tell them that when you eat a particular thing it harms you this way. But they have this mentality that we will eat what we are eating and we like spicy food only, we cannot eat bland food.', 'No, there was one lady who had pressure, that means blood pressure problem. She was pregnant and from that time itself she had the blood pressure problem. I told her that you should eat less salt. But she said I don’t like that food. And she was taking salt.', 'No, it’s not like that. Variety of people stay here. It is not like that suppose it is Vanchara, then only Vanchara and their community stay in one area. Everybody like Parmar, Chamar, Solenki Vanchara stays here. And everybody stay together. But they have the feeling that certain people are Bhangi and we should not eat food from their house. They have that kind of things.', 'Enthusiastically to the level that they give food to the full Tekra people. Rich people will only think of celebrating these festivals in certain way or by giving food to certain number of people, whereas these people would definitely give food for the entire village.', 'No everybody gives their own contribution, whom so ever wants to give how much ever. And then they give food to the whole village.', 'Everybody eats outside foods. But after anganwadi had started, it had reduced because we hardly allow them to bring packets from outside. And we cook fresh snacks over here and give them. Because of that malnutrition has been reduced to quite an extent. Before when we started the anganwadi, then all the children were malnourished.  But now slowly it has been reduced. Now their mothers tell us that “Sister, after eating your snacks, when children come home they don’t eat food at our house. Once they eat at your place, then in the evening only they need food.”', 'Yes, mothers tell. But then mothers go outside. After that children will go out and buy and eat it.', 'They would listen, but the grandparents are there. They would say “Okay take this money, go outside and eat the food.” So grandparents also teach such things to children. This is what happens.', 'No, they eat food very much.', 'They want spicy and food with onion garlic.', 'Yes, here kids eat less sweet and people in this area also eat less sweet. But they eat spicy and food with onion garlic more.', 'They eat more chilli. They have this habit, so they eat more chilli.', 'The small kids are thin, they don’t get weight properly because they eat packet food from outside. In summer they eat that pepsi and ice, therefore they get cough and cold and keep falling sick again and again. So even if their weight get increased little bit, again it falls and comes down.', 'No, it is not like that. They have very less sweet. When some guest come home, then they make Shira. Nothing else as sweet is cooked in their house. Sometimes they get those wheat bulgur and they get Lapsy from that. They don’t cook any other sweet. That also the children or people of house eat very less. They eat those in very less quantity. But they eat a lot of spicy food.', 'If you eat food properly from time to time and avoid those things that doctor advises you to do, then diabetes can be cured. So many people have now understood that and they are trying little bit. But what happens is that same food is cooked for everyone in a house and they all eat from that itself little bit.', \"In the morning they have tea and snacks and at around 12 o'clock they have food. In the afternoon everybody have tea.\", 'It will be Roti and Sabji, Kichdi or dal rice.', 'No. They will only do like that only when the doctor confirms a disease and recommend bland food or ask to avoid particular food.', 'The elderly people may know and understand that if a person is feeling giddy then lemon juice need to be given or if somebody gets acidity then should be taken to the doctor. Also they tell them not to eat fried foods.', 'No. He eats too much of outside food.', 'I don’t eat food from outside.', \"No, I eat homely food. We have a business of cotton wick, just like a labor only. When I go home I will do this cotton work for 4 or 5 hours. And in the next morning their father will take whatever I had made, to sell. \\xa0Now he does this hockery business in the morning and so he feels hungry, and eats snacks from outside. And after finishing his round, he comes to home at around 2 or 3 o'clock. So after coming home also he would feel hungry  and like that he eat too much of outside food. In the evening also he goes to do the business and takes round. If he feels like to come home and eat, \\xa0he does that.  Otherwise,  suppose when he meets his friends from outside, when used to eat snacks with them also.\", 'Yes, he brought her in the house by doing love marriage. But he may or may not earn. And that lady’s husband will drink alcohol and come home and beats his own wife. And then also he would eat everything and throw away the remaining food.', 'Yes, but there are 4 or 5 houses in the lower area where there is little bit of problems. They go to collect papers from the garbage. Sometimes they collect in the morning or sometimes they do that work whole night. In morning they separate the materials, then they sell it and have food with whatever money they had got out from selling that. There are 4 or 5 houses like that. And on the upper area there are well living people. They do labor or jobs. But they are normal people.', 'May be because we do meetings with them and we explain to them lot of things like how much more attention you need to pay to the children, don’t allow them to eat outside food, then it is good for your children. And also we tell them to improve and imbibe good culture in your children. So they will pay attention and take care for that.', 'Yes, \\xa0like how Meenakshi Ben told when the madam comes then they treat her nicely by giving food, snacks and all.', 'If something is needed to be told to someone, then Bharti Ben is kind of a person who would tell things immediately to them, even if the person feels bad. She doesn’t care about whether the person calls or doesn’t call afterwards. If some advice is needed to be given to a person, then she will definitely tell that “See, this is not good”, “This is the right thing” or “Why are you doing wrong thing” .There was a lady in our area whose husband has got sick and he was given blood from which he has got HIV. At first husband got affected, then when they checked for children, thankfully they were not HIV positive. His medication is going on. \\xa0They have two sons and one daughter. But their condition is very bad. They are getting food to eat by doing labor. He got HIV through blood transfusion. At first one person got and now his wife also got it. So now two people in a house is having HIV. By luck only the children has not got HIV. So at some place this kind of conditions are there.', 'Meenakshi Ben told know that they use to eat very less of sweets. They eat more of spicy and fried food. They drink a lot of tea, \\xa0so the sugar is used in that.', 'They eat more spicy and fried foods.', 'Yes, Meenakshi Ben told know that in Sabji also there will be more of oil and spices.', 'No, they have eaten salt for every day. Then they would not like the taste of bland food. They will not think like since the doctor has advised it will be good for my health and will benefit me. No, they will not think like that.', 'Yes. In our side it is good. Many people there do jobs at many places. Many of them give education to girls as well as boys. And it is not like that the girls are not sent for studying, but all children are studying. And people are fashionable also. They are living in normal way. At some places like Vadyari Vas and Vanchara Vas, the condition is like this where everyone is doing labor only. In the morning they do labour, in the afternoon they collect recyclable materials from garbage and separate it and they come home after getting the money. In many houses it is like they get daily food by doing those labor. It is like how Meenakshi Ben told. They eat chilli and roti or in some house they just have tea and roti and they sleep. In many houses it is like if wife has got money , husband will beat her and take the money. They drink alcohol and comes home. It is like these only.', 'No, \\xa0no but some people may have lot of trouble. Those people who go for collecting recyclable materials from Garbage, for them it is like daily earning and daily eating with that. So those poor people are occupied in doing the same thing everyday, like everyday morning they are back to the same condition.', 'No, \\xa0they don’t store \\xa0the ration, Because they earn on daily basis and bring food on daily basis. If there is a salary for a month, then only you will get ration on monthly basis. If you are earning for a day, then and how can you store for a month.', 'Yes, They earn for the day and bring food for that day. They are not able to store the food.', 'Everyday they make Sabji and roti. \\xa0In the evening they make kichdi sometimes. So they make \\xa0kichdi or Sabji, and like that.', 'They get food from outside like puri or bread. \\xa0They eat like that.', \"If somebody is sick, then separate food is cooked for them. At least we make. \\xa0My husband have diabetes, 2 to 4 years back he got paralysis. Then I kept him in Manibhen for 4 months. My elder son was doing 12th at that time. Then my poor son were driving Rickshaw in the night. And I brought my mother, \\xa0so that she would take care of my house and children and I would come in the morning, after taking bath, to Anganwadi. And at three o'clock I would take the tiffin and go to hospital. And like that I had suffered a lot for 4 to 5 months. It was such that two people need to hold him to make him sit. But now he drives auto.\", 'Now we came to know that, \\xa0when we eat pulses, etc. we get nutrients. So now we cook those things only like green vegetables and all.', \"Yes, \\xa0everybody enjoys food and they like to eat. \\xa0But I don't get time.\", 'No, \\xa0none of us have the habit of eating from outside.', 'Yes, \\xa0Chilli, salt \\xa0and whole food is required.', 'Yes. For him it will be a separate food. And for the rest of us it will be different food.', \"But government is taking profit and all these things are going on. So poor remains poor only. Because whatever they are earning, they are using it for drinking alcohol. And the condition of poor wife and children remain the same. They don't even get food eat. \\xa0And that is the situation of these poor people.\", 'Yes, \\xa0there will be problem for food, \\xa0also he beats and we cannot tell them anything. Because when they drink alcohol and come, \\xa0we cannot speak to them anything.', 'Yes, \\xa0we need to be them also, \\xa0we need to shout at them also. So that they are little scared. So I have kept the control right from the beginning. Because their father was like he would drink and eat non vegetarian food. So I had suffered a lot with the father of my children. Then the girls who might get married into my house also will suffer. \\xa0Her life also would get spoilt if I am not taking care. I were told like that I have to bear everything and I stayed. But nowadays nobody will bear.', 'I had suffered a lot because he used to drink alcohol and eat non vegetarian food. So at first he spent everything for drinking alcohol and eating non vegetarian food. Then he became physically sick. I had good number of children so after that I had worked a lot. So I had suffered. \\xa0And therefore I need my children to get good education. So that they will get good future.', 'See the first thing is that sugar is only used in morning, in tea only. But after that nobody eats sweets.', 'Yes, \\xa0everybody eat spicy food.', 'We only make Sabji. Only sometimes when we feel like to eat, \\xa0then we make Shira, that also is made of jaggery.', 'I know that one should not eat sweet. Are you talking about food?', 'No, \\xa0I eat everything.', 'No, \\xa0we make very spicy food for us. \\xa0So he himself will say to make separate food for him.', 'Yes when they come we make different food. We make Mishthan, sweet like Shira. And now it is hot and therefore we get mango juice.', \"Yes, but they don't understand that. If a guest has come, then we will have to go and bring them, we will have to give them gifts and do things for them even if we have to take loans for that. So even by taking loans, we have to do hospitality for them. Sometimes if there is occurring some ceremony, then also we will have to go there even by taking loans. It is like that in our community.\", 'No, if we want to make like that we make a that moment only. We make hot food and eat.', 'We have done quite a lot of things here. We had done camps against alcohol, about family planning and recently in last month on T.B. So we give them lot of awareness. But the man himself should think of leaving alcohol.  Families would always force them to leave the alcohol. If he himself is telling that he want to leave alcohol, then he can be helped.  But if they have been sent to rehabilitation centers because of some other’s force, then he would stay there for 2 or 3 days and will run away from there. Right now the expenditure in those rehabilitation centers is about 7000-8000 rupees. They will provide the medication from there but we ourselves have to manage the food and accommodation. So twice in a week we need to take food there and pay for accommodation also. So the total expense is around 7000 rupees approximately. But the institution says if they are ready to leave the addiction by themselves, then they will bear the expense. But they don’t show any interest or response for that.', 'Their eating habits are normally like us only. They store a few things. But mostly they buy on daily basis. For today, they will buy today and eat it today itself.', 'Yes. And they eat good food. It is not like that they just let it go and eat bad. It may happen like when ladies go for collecting papers from garbage, so they may or may not get time. So then they give money to kids as they cook food late in the afternoon and they buy from shops like packed foods. But the food that they cook is nice food, even though it is twice in a day.', 'No. And they would bring everything in small quantity every day. Like oil for 10 rupees, rice for 10 rupees, sugar and tea are also bought like that.', 'Yes. Hardly a few people store food items. But most of them do this way.', 'It is only in tea.', 'No some people will observe it strictly. In those food if there is a restricted item then they would eat something else.', \"We use to keep here on Saturday for ladies and they would come around 3 o’clock in the afternoon. We try two or three times to make them do exercises. So they will understand that they can do this from home also. But they don't have time, \\xa0they are very busy. They go in the night for collecting the garbage material,  in the morning they do the sorting,  they need to cook food, get children ready and send them to school. Their whole day goes in all these things . In afternoon that take rest for 2 hours. Then again they have their routine. So they don't have time. They have scarcity of time especially for ladies.\", \"It may happen sometimes that they don't have money with them. Then they come and ask us Give something as loan as we don't have money. We will pay you back whenever we get money” . Many ladies do like that.\", 'First of all this place is Ramapir No\\xa0Tekro. So these Ramapir people have Norta for 9 days. So all 9 days everybody gathers together and on 9th day they have one big celebration where they give food to everyone. The temple people would collect money from everyone or the leader would spend his own money , to give food to the people from the entire Tekra . So such fair is done. Also there are done some celebrations like marriages. Also during Navratri, people use to gather for 9 days. Dasara is also very popular, so on Dasara there use to have one big fair because people have been fasted for the 9 days. People stay awake all night which is called Jagaran and there will be celebrations on road.', 'No. They call only relatives.', 'When? At the time of festival?', 'Yes. Many times that happen. Because we have seen such things here like if guest comes they will take care of those guests, even if they don’t have anything to eat for themselves .So they borrow things and will give food for the guests.', 'Despite of their situation, like even if they don’t have money, they have to take care of the guest because of their prestige in the community. And if they are not taking care of them, then it is like insulting the guest. So it is their first duty, to give food to the guests. They also will never keep their kids hungry, they feed them anyhow, at least by borrowing, but they themselves will stay hungry. Children will never remain hungry. They themselves may remain hungry for one day, but for kids, somehow they may manage food and feed them. If their condition is so bad, then if there is any relatives staying nearby, they will also help. See if you don’t have anything at home, then they would give one bowl of kichdi, Sabji. They use to take care in that way.', 'They stayed almost 2 months here. It was a vacation time and so Manav Sadhna was closed on 15th . So the food becomes a problem for them and as they are South Indians they want rice and dal. Since my cooking is good, we developed very good bonding in 3 to 4 months. If they want to go anywhere to roam in Ahmedabad or if they want to know any information, then they use to take both of us with them.', 'It is cooked in twice a day.', 'They eat heavy food.', 'Roti and Sabji will be there, along with that they will get outside food also. Also people over here eat more of mutton and fish.', 'It is more.', 'They like sweet and spicy food.', 'All tasty food and sweets.', 'Yes, to make sweet dal. There is no other things. Also when the children feels the food as spicy, \\xa0they add sugar in that as well.', 'Yes, for tea and while eating.', 'No, you can visit the kitchen and check right now when the food is cooked.', 'No, opposite only. Then you will get an idea about how the food is cooked.', 'Their mentality is just opposite. All their food will be stopped, also some people will keep distance from them .', 'They know that, when we are eating certain food, will cause diabetes and what happens because of that. They know that much.', 'They will feed them fully.', 'Now the situation has improved a lot because employment has increased and somehow they use to get work. There are many families who have shifted from their state and are staying over here. In the initial stage they had problem of getting meals. But those who are staying here for years manage their food somehow, like the ladies who come to Rudra, they don’t do just Rudra work. For example they would be running a stitching machine at home or they would do work for 5 or 10 rupees for somebody. So their expense will be managed by that. Like that now the intensity of starving has reduced. Otherwise there were so many families who used to have food in the morning and don’t know what they would have in the evening.', 'Yes, the time when I was 12 years old. When I was a teenager. The reason behind leaving my studies was financial problem. Because if there is a problem of food, how can you manage studying?', 'May be they don’t have any idea about this wholesome nutritious food. The moment the word nutritious comes, they think that they have to spend. They feel that it is expensive food and from that they get nutrition. But they still need awareness in the area that having seasonal food or cooking in a particular way and eating.', 'Even people like us have just started reading, and so we have an idea that nutritious food is not expensive.', 'Right ? We can make by taking seasonal food and eat it by cooking in a different way.', 'That understanding is less. The older generation is there know, who is very much older. Right now my grand mother-in-law is there to stay with me. She is around 85 to 90 years old and  still she is very fit that she gets up early in the morning, takes bath, follows her rituals, does prayer, does maala and then she will have breakfast. I asked her how is she so fit. She told me her food habits and all, that she use to eat this food, use to do these things, use to stay like that and use to have rule that they shouldn’t eat after a certain time. So they used to follow the diet. In those times the diet was called as rules which they had to follow.', 'May be those haven’t passed on because in this generation there are some good things, but one of the biggest negative thing that have entered is we have stopped listening to our older generations. A lot of the things that these elder people say are useless, but the talks that is related to the food and values are important. But we think they are just blabbering. The situation has become such that the people are now asking them back that “How do you know the requirements of the present time?”. This is what happened. But if we are understanding the way of the food and the way of living they had or if we are listening to them we can understand how even at this age they are walking. We have started having problems of knee pain at such a young age. Why they don’t have? The reason could be that they were having pure food. Apart from that they have lived their life very carefully like in the way of eating food and all.', 'People of all types lives here. Those who need tasty food and also those who eat whatever they get. Majority of those who have importance for the taste use that red chilli powder and more of oil. If you see their sabji, the oil will be floating on the top and the chilli has to be so strong that if their tongue doesn’t get burned, they feel that the food is bland. They say that vegetable is like cow dung. So they will never accept salads. They cant imagine food with less spice and chilli.', 'Because they have struggle every day. They have to work hard for everything. So they will feel like “Rather than giving one hour over here, if I am going out and work there for one hour, then I will get money. Then I can eat food with that money. My children can study with that money. I can buy clothes with that money. I can manage my social commitments with that money”. So they have this kind of mentality at all levels, it can be more or less. So still explaining this is in process.', 'It is very difficult with males, because they too much of ego. We are trying to work on it. But they have this feeling that they are doing the most work that is there in the world. Whereas wives are doing full day, as they go out and do labor work and come. Still they have this kind of expectation from them that “When I come home, you have to serve food to me. You should be available at home. You finish the entire household work and then sleep ”. It is like that. When they finish their work and come home, they would not do anything. A glass of water also need to be given into their hands. There are only a very few husbands who help their wives or support them in everything. Even if they cannot help in their work, at least they will give mental support like “Okay, I am there with you”. There are very few like that.', 'The quantity of sugar is more. It is mostly in tea. The rate of drinking tea is very high in the area, where I am staying and working currently.', 'Yes. I have a friend who is in the Institute itself. His father has been hospitalized. He has an ulcer in his lungs. It is a very big ulcer. He has the habit of having slaked lime. So doctor has told him that “You should not have the slaked lime”. Medicine is on and the slaked lime is also on.', 'As soon as you are getting conceived, you are taking advice from the doctor, medicine is started and all the medicines are taken regularly and reports are taken. Sonography and whatever is need to be done, all are done on a regular basis. Everybody knows that as everyone, including husband and mother-in-law, is given instructions like to give her certain kind of food or not to give certain kind of food, to live in a particular way or not to live in a particular way, right? If not 100 percent, but at least they might be following it at least 80 percent know. Even then why are they not able to have a normal delivery on the last day.', 'There are many habits.', \"They don't eat food on right time. This is also a bad habit. Also in morning as soon as they get up, \\xa0they would drink one or two cups of tea just like that. That is also a bad habit. That also need to be corrected. Then they used to eat the previous night’s roti on the next day morning, which creates acidity. That also need to be corrected. They use to eat more of chilli and oil. They know that we get acidity and gas due to that, but they like it so they eat it.\", 'Both are there. \\xa0There are some who are vegetarian and there are some who are non-vegetarian. Maybe non vegetarians are more. Even if there is so much hot outside, there are people who would cook non vegetarian food and eat. Okay.', 'I had started as an anganwadi teacher and worked as the anganwadi teacher for about 3 years. But at that time Manav Sadhna had 4 to 5 anganwadis. In those, like how the children are being taught in the private preschools I use to teach the children and give them nutritious food as well . And at that time we were not as partners with the government. Since 2004, the Manav Sadhna and thus anganwadi has started its partnership with the Gujarat government. So from 2004 onwards, I had been worked as an anganwadi supervisor and from 2007 onwards I had been worked as an anganwadi coordinator. So right from the beginning I am attached with the program of anganwadi. And for last 2 years I am with Manav Sadhna’s International Volunteer Programme.', 'We are working for the children who are up to six years old. In that case there is not coming such a situation and they are not capable to understand that why they should not go out in sun or why they should not eat certain things. So we try to make them understand the things in a funnier way. Suppose they had pepsi, then we tell them that “See, you had got cold know. You are having that pepsi, right ? That is why it is happening. See you fall sick and got fever know. You ate this thing, right? So this had happened”. But our work is mainly with the child’s parents. We do this work of awareness with their parents. Children don’t understand these things. The child’s intelligence has not yet developed enough to understand what is right and what is wrong for them. We explain to their parents that “Why you are not hindering them from eating those Pepsi, Kurkure or that two rupees packet Paplu. As there is no nutrition in that, your money is getting wasted and your child’s health is getting spoiled. Then you will have to pay money to the doctor as well, because when the child eat things like Pepsi or other fried items, his health will get spoiled. Rather you send them to anganwadi, then your child will be taken care of , will get nutritious food, would sit here nicely for 3 or 4 hours and would learn something . ”', \"As I talk about relationship, it is very complicated to understand. Because the loving relationship between the parents and their children are there only in very few families. It is not like that they don't care for their children or don't love their children. But their way of showing love and care is different. But there are only a very few families where there is unity or love, and those give love to their child, won’t beat the child and the wish of the child is also considered. Whereas in most of the families it is like that “The children have to do whatever we say”, ”We can beat them”, ”We can behave in the way we want to behave with them” or \\xa0“We can speak anything in front of them”. So there is not much awareness about the values and the culture that needs to be passed on to them. Like they are not aware of the thing that whatever we do or whatever we speak is noticed by the children or what will happen to his future if he is not going to school or what will happen to his health if he is eating such type of food.  So these types of worries and care are less. And it is because of the atmosphere in which they have stayed and grown, considering the parents as well . I think that they have less of those feelings or awareness that the first and foremost duty of a parent is to pass good value and culture to their kids. It is their first responsibility and that is less there. So for them the loving relationship with the children or opening up the relationship when the children is becoming young, whether it is boys or girls, are very less. There it is like a one sided relationship that parents are superior and the children have to follow them. Parents can beat them or behave in the way they want to behave. It’s been thought very less that the children also have their self-respect.\", 'There are problems in some of the families. But it is not like that they don’t even have food to eat. They have electronic devices in their houses, have cell phones and have smartphones as well. They have T.V, cooler and also have vehicles.', \"Many people used to do the cooking in morning and in the evening they need to go out by taking the cart. So they cook around 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock, \\xa0together for both the times. They eat lunch and then they take the food with them.\", 'So there are different communities. \\xa0For example these ladies are from the anganwadis of the Sabarmati area and these people have pattern like this. And the people from Rajasthan have a different pattern for eating food. \\xa0Those who have migrated from villages of Gujarat have a different pattern for eating food. What do Rajasthan people eat?', 'What is it?', 'For that person they might make different kichdi.', 'It is the same way like how we use to do. Suppose if somebody is having diabetes, \\xa0then for them we will use less sweet or would remove sugar or jaggery from their food, right? They also do like that.', 'They will keep the food separate and would add jaggery or sugar accordingly.', \"Yes, spicy means they have to eat spicy. In so much of heat as well, \\xa0they eat so much spicy food that when I am trying to eat that food I may feel giddy. They eat that much spicy food. How much ever monetary problem they are having, \\xa0irrespective of that they want to eat it by putting so much of oil. They put too much of oil in things like Bhakri or fried things. They will definitely eat like that and for that they would do how much ever hard work they need to do, even if they are having some problems or are suffering. Also they face lot of problems because of that like stomach problems or piles. But they don't compromise on their food habits.\", 'Once they are starting to have those problems they come to know about it.', 'In that comes eating spicy food, \\xa0fried food,  too much of sweets or eating too many chillies.', 'Today only I had an argument with one lady. She goes to sell coconuts. I told her that “Your child is eating Pepsi and other outside things the whole day. He is roaming on the ground whole day without any slippers. And he didn’t come in anganwadi”. Then she says that “See we don’t keep our children in our house. Also we spend 60 to 70 rupees for them” . Then I told her that “But this is not home cooked food. You may gave Choco bar of 5 rupees or packet food of 10 rupees. He use to eat Sav Murmura. But not the home cooked food, right”. Then she answered that “We don’t mind in spending 60 or 70 rupees for our children. We are not like you”. This happened today.', 'They say it with very much pride, that my child is using 50 rupees per day. On Tekra, we try to tell them. But they say like “My child spends 50 rupees per day”. Then I ask him that “Okay, for 50 rupees what did he ate? Pepsi or those fryums. If you had given any nutritious food, then tell me. ” Then I ask them that “Did you get 2 packets of milk? Did you give him milk?”. They give tea to the children.', 'Right now in our slums, there is no problem of money to have food. They have money. But with that, they don’t know “What to eat?”. Either they don’t know or they don’t want to know.', 'More than what they see, they considers about the taste of their tongue or what they like to eat. What they use to do is, they put too much of oil, chilli and salt. So the actual taste goes. So they almost burns the original taste. They cook everything spicy and put lot of oil. So for whatever their tongue has the taste, like potato, onion or garlic, those three they have maximum. It is not always like that. They use to take green vegetables as well, like spinach. But they make that also as spicy. So the original taste gets burned. They cook it so much, so that it may get stuck in the vessel. Like that they cook and eat so much. So then you won’t get the nutritious value out of that.', 'Will power is very strong as such. Because I feel that it is just because of that will power, they are managing their lives in such an adverse condition. That is what my observation is and they don’t complaint. Even if a lady is eating food in once a day, she will never complain that “I have problem and I am not getting food to eat”. Gents also will not complain. You will see them smiling. I think that is will power and a positive way. I would say more than will power, it is like hopelessness that “Despite of whatever I do, my life will go like this only”. Or they would say like “Bhabhie, this children are going to remain like this only”, “We will remain like this only” or “Nothing can be done”.', 'Yes, we tell them', 'Yes, they want spicy food.', 'Mainly it is because that the whole culture has been developed like that. Eating spicy is their culture, like how there is a culture in majority of Gujarati people to eat sweets. Like we need sweets in almost everything, because in my house we put sugar or jaggery in almost everything like in vegetable or the other things. Also after eating we wanted to have something sweet. There is a pattern like that. In the same way this Rajasthan and U.P will be having their pattern. And in the same way it has become a culture for these people to eat food with a lot of chilli. So we have to remove it from one entire generation and that needs lot of time. Also if you see what is the incentive for them, it is only food. And in that it is the taste. Which are the other things in their lives right from the morning to the evening, which gives them happiness ? It is mostly the spicy food and whatever addiction they are having. So we can consider this habit of eating spicy food as one of the addiction itself. So it has been intricated in their culture.', 'For the tea it is like, even if they don’t have food it is okay for them. But they need the tea mandatorily. Their attitude is such that, whether we live or die, they need tea for sure. They have this attitude. They don’t care about the thing that they might not be able to live long or not. They know that “We would die at an early age, if we are drinking alcohol”. But they are not able to leave that. In a way their will power is very strong, but not in this matter. In a way their will power is very strong, because right from the morning they use to stand in the que for water, they use to do a lot of hard work.', 'They use to try for hardly for 4 days or something like that.', 'They try, but they will not like it.', 'Yeah, they tell us that “We cannot manage without sugar.”', 'Another thing is that they will not lie in front of us. They won’t say like “They didn’t eat”. They tell whatever they had done. At least to these people they would tell the truth. For example, there is a Mahesh Bhai who is the watchman in Paryavaran Mitra.', 'Using different strategies means, in that to motivate them to maximum, we have to tell them like that “If you are not sending your children to school or if you are giving this type of food to your children, then these are the harm and disadvantages that will happen to your children”. We also tell them that “You have stayed in the slum for your whole life. Then do you want your children also stay and live in the same way? Then their life will also go in the same way itself.”', 'No.', 'We never give them motivation with gift, money or anything like that . Our motivation is like suppose if there is any emergency in the family, like if the child is seriously sick, then we will tell that “Don’t worry about money. Manav Sadhna will take care of the treatment of the child. The sister in the anganwadi will help you”. But we never give money or any other gifts in their hand, because that is entirely a wrong concept. That is like we are making them greedy. Then we would never know if others are trying to take wrong advantage from that. They would try to blackmail you emotionally. If you are giving it to one person, you have to be answerable. You have an accountability in the community. They would come and ask you that “You had given it to that person and why not to me?”. Then you should have an answer. If you can’t reply, then you will lose their trust. You cannot do like helping one person and not helping other person. You can’t do like that. You have to be answerable for everything that you are doing in the community. Community will ask you questions like “You had given dress to that lady”, “You had given food or packet to that lady” and “Why not me?” or “You are giving snacks to this person and why not me?”. All lady will come and would ask you like “ You are giving food to their children, why not me?”. Then you have to explain to them. So you are accountable for that and the answer needs to be given.', 'For Anemia? It is because of their eating habits. Mainly it is because of their eating habits, also because of their culture like they would give foods first to gents or boys. Also they have concepts that girls don’t need to have a fat body as they are not going out for works. They don’t need to be fat or like that.', \"Yes, the talk would be only about what you are giving. We use tell them that there are Anganwadis, which is a long term planning made by the government for you, which means that if you are sending your child to Anganwadis, you will not get benefit right tomorrow itself. After five year old if your child is going to schools, that time you will see the benefit, because of the education and nutrition that the child has got. But when you explain all these things to them it will not go into their mind. They would ask that what is the government doing. I use to tell them that the government has made the anganwadis, they made schools, government has done that, you send your children to there so that their life will prosper. I use to tell them that suppose if we are giving you money then tomorrow it will be used, but if the child gets good culture and good education, it will remain there for his whole life. But they cannot see that, because their life is such that they have to see only short term benefits. They have become used to it. It is not their fault, because they don't have anything with them for a long term. Every day they have to earn for every day’s food.\", 'Then they borrow and get things', 'There is a gobar gas plant over there, so food is cooked with that which belongs to us only.(saying jokingly)', 'No. We should not talk to them in the language in which he is talking. Like if he is talking with temperament, then you should not talk with temperament. If we are not doing that then there will be fight. But when the person is angry, we should smile and talk. When that person is smiling or doing something like that, then at that time we can get little bit angry on them. I use to do like that. At that time I can be angry on that person and can ask that “Do you have any idea about what will you do with these four kids, when you are having scarcity of food at home for them?“', 'At morning 7.30 would go to school, come home at 12.30, at 2’oclock I come here for tuition, at 5.30 we will be going home.

We showed them a movie also which shows how to stay in the house, how to tackle it, don’t spit anywhere, have good food.', 'Diabetes is there, but they get it done from the private hospitals. They do regular checkups for diabetes. Also, there are 10 to 15 patients of diabetes in our place as well.

There are patients who tell that “I have diabetes and I don’t want to eat”.', 'For those who have heart diseases, the treatment is done in government hospitals. So, when they come to us we explain to them, that you have to eat less salt, don’t take much stress, and take medicines regularly and do regular checkups.

They keep a caution and make sure that they don’t take extra salt on top.', 'Yes. If there is some marriage somewhere and if they have that food, then only it is used. Otherwise regularly it is not used.', 'Yes, he checks the patients.\\xa0 Like if there is a confirmed fever, then we start the routine treatment,\\xa0like for fever, Analgesic or something like that and then we do the tests. Or sometimes when the patients come with the reports\\xa0directly and it is already diagnosed that he has malaria, then we just have to write the treatment for malaria.\\xa0 Then we will explain it to the patient and will give the print out of the prescription to him. Then sir would explain to the patients that, “You have to take this treatment”. Also, we explain everything in Gujarati. Our prescription is also in the local language like “This medicine should be taken in the morning or in the evening and take the medicine after\\xa0the meal or before the meals”. Also, we tell them orally about the other precautions that has to be taken.  Also secondly, there is a book of diabetes. In the book it is been written that if a diabetic patient is there, then what is to be eaten, what is not to be eaten, which exercise has to be done, what type of food has to be taken, what are the cares to be taken, what happen if diabetes is reduced.\\xa0All those things have been written in that book. “What happen if the diabetes is reduced”, the problems for that is also written. If it reduces too much, then to control that what has to be done. The tablets for that is also written inside. When the patient is coming for the first time, then we will write and give him. Also we keep sugar tablets with it. Then if the person is at home, then he can have anything with that sugar tablet, like lemon juice, or if they are travelling in the bus, then at that time we will not have sugar with us, then he has to keep that tablets in his pocket.\\xa0So, we explain all these things.', \"Once he registers from outside,\\xa0his name gets entered into today's list.

If you click here in today's list, then you will get the list of today’s patients. There will be a card made outside which has been kept by the staff over here. When his number comes there are four cards. For example, suppose there are three patients then first will be his card. Suppose his name is Ramesh Bhai, then there will be a card of Ramesh Bhai. When we select his name from here (showing on the screen), it enters in today’s list. As we see here, whatever patients are sitting there in the OPD, all of their names will come here.  Then we have to select from that. So, then his name is loaded. Right now, I am loading from routine patient. This is his last prescription, that is what is the last treatment that has been done. Some patients would do routine follow up. Like diabetic patients or cardiac patients, those patients come regularly. So, his treatment is fixed, that these different types of treatment are going on for him. For this person, right from the beginning he has bronchitis, diabetes and blood pressure. So, right now these treatments are in progress. \\xa0Now, when he comes with the new problem like, for example, diarrhea. Then we write his problem over here. This is the box for problems. These are the parameters, like how much is the BP. If the patient has come with the problem of diarrhea, then it is compulsory to check the BP. Whether BP is reduced or not, then according to that we should increase or decrease the dosage of the BP medicine. If a person has BP and diabetes, and that person has got diarrhea and vomiting, then at first we have to stop this two medicines. This Diamicron and this one, that means the medicine for the blood pressure and diabetes.  Either they have to be reduced or if they are not taking any food, then it needs to be stopped. Then we have to prescribe the treatment over here. Whichever is the fixed prescription for diarrhea, if I selected diarrhea from here,\\xa0then the prescription for the diarrhea is fixed.

Because they eat too much food, they have a habit of eating too much food.', 'The very first reason is because of food habit. They eat and drink from outside. Also, they are unhygienic. There is a community acquired pneumonia and in that there are people who are immuno-compromised. Those who have HBsAG, HIV or HC infections, are immune-compromised right from the beginning. They get these infections immediately. So, pneumonia happens also because of weather and so they get infections from each other. The swine flu which is going on right now, in that in a very shorter period like 3 or 4 days itself, pneumonia happens. In such cases community acquired cross infection occurs.', 'Such patients do come in very lower class. But that is hardly 1 or 2 percent. For such patients, we use to do lot of concessions for medicine, sampling and in bill as well.', 'Most of the problems are caused because of food habits. Those who are suffering from stomach diseases, like jaundice, loose motion and vomiting, typhoid, are caused because of food habits.', 'Generally, they are going wrong by eating from outside. The hygienic food that is cooked in house is not bad. May be some might be there in the lower class. But those who are eating the food from outside or those who eat the street food on the road, fall into problem.', 'Yes. There is a problem of cleanliness. Also food, like how they are preserving the food, when do they cook it, how many days old cooked food is used. Those things also affect.', 'So, mainly it is the problem with food.', 'No, that awareness is very less. The awareness of eating nutritious food is there only in higher middle-class and higher class. Still the awareness, that we should take this kind of nutritional food in this way or we should have only this much food like oily food should not be taken, has not come in the middle class.', 'The reason could be lack of literacy or knowledge about health like what type of food should be taken or hygienic food should be taken or in hygienic food what type of food should be taken. That awareness is still not there. Therefore, it is creating the problem.', 'Yes, all love food. In spite of giving them instructions, they don’t follow it. For the diabetes patients, we use to give them diet. But, once they go home, they forget everything. And they eat whatever they what to eat. Mostly who comes with uncontrolled diabetes won’t be having proper food habits.', 'From here they use to listen to whatever instructions we give. We tell them that you should do these and these things. But such patients always fail and because of that only, these things are happening. Their food habit is bad at home, as they don’t keep curtailments. Only for those people, it becomes uncontrolled in this way. Hardly for one percent it might happen because of some other mistake. For those who don’t take proper medicine and don’t have proper eating habits, the disease goes uncontrolled.', 'Such things happen more often. We get more of such complaints. Those who come with grandparents use to tell more complaints that “Even if we tell them not to eat, they are eating. Please explain to them about the food habits. They are not supposed to eat chilli and sweet things. Still they are eating”. We use to hear such things very frequently.', 'Along with medicine, we have to give them knowledge about the disease, about their food habits. Also have to give them knowledge about their age that, “Now this is your age and your organs may not work as intact as before, so have to take diet in this way”. So like this we can make that person aware about that. Or else some new centers have to be created, where according to the age and the disease, they would give you the explanation about the food habits, that “You have to take diet only in this particular way” or “You will become good, only when you take this particular diet”. So such things should be done. If such centers are opened, then it will make a lot of difference.', 'One is hereditary, that means it may be got from the previous generation. The person gets it from there. Those people have 70 percent chance for getting diabetes. Secondly, food habits and also obesity. So, because of obesity, food habits, hereditary and sedentary lifestyle, which involves just keep sitting, not doing any work out, the chance of getting diabetes increases.', 'Such things happen in the case of food habits. I don’t see that in any other things.', 'Another thing is about food habits. You can add that whether the patient is obese or with an average body. So for that you can give dietary advice.', 'Yeah, we are getting labor charges. Yes, we get the job and we get enough money to have our food. Whether we get it or not, we have to come here every day. Sometimes, we might get someone who offer us Chutak (the work that is not based on contract) work. Then we would go to his house for doing that work. On that day we tell the contractor that we are not coming today, since we are going for Chutak work today.', 'Are you asking about us?', 'Generally, we make dal rice.

So she will have to take leave in the school and all those would happen, right? Teacher also tells her.', 'Yes, teacher explains. She said that teacher told that, “Tell your mother to give me only this kind of food, light food like dal rice, dal roti such things”. In jaundice you cannot give roti as well.

In the evening playing time, they should play and have to go for tuition at the respective time for tuition. So at there it is compulsory to do like that. So they have a little bit of your fear. If I go a little further from that, then the teacher will shout at me. Right now, he has come for vacation. Still he has the fear inside, thinking that “When I go to school, then if my mother says something, then the teacher will shout at me”.

      "['Hardly any boys go for studying, many boys just roam about. Lot of foul language is spoken in the house. So right from childhood kids also get influenced by this and there is 100 percent chance that they go on wrong path.', 'No, nobody has the feeling that my son is doing something wrong and so I should correct, like how do we take care when it is our child. Now it is like go and do what you want to do. Even to their parents they speak dirty foul language which we can’t even listen to. But parents would not ask them about why you are talking this kind of language.', 'Yes, within themselves. Siblings and parents keeps fighting by speaking foul languages to each other. For them fighting means speaking bad languages to each other. They don’t fight normally. They speak lot of foul languages.', 'They know all the languages, but rough language.', 'Not like that, only Gujarati and Hindi we can see. First of all mostly here are Gujarati only, nobody is Hindi.', 'They keep Hindi as their language. Sometimes Gujarati is there. And English is also there, but very rarely. Ladies mostly use Gujarati and Hindi only.', 'Hindi and Gujarati. These two languages.', 'The English is there.', 'Mostly Gujarati. They may understand Hindi but they can’t speak.', 'Most of the people know Gujarati. Marvadi people know Hindi.', 'I am comfortable with Gujarati. \\xa0Hindi I can understand, but I may not be able to speak.', 'I have no idea about how do they use it.', 'Then they will be using Gujarati only.', 'Yes, they all must be knowing that the Gujarati language can be used in the phone.', 'Gujarati.', 'Majority of people use Gujarati.', 'Yes, \\xa0they are from here and also there are people who came from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, where there is not Gujarati language.', 'Normally there is Gujarati.', 'That also, only the vocal language.', 'They cannot even speak the pure Gujarati properly. They speak the simple vocal language.', 'This only. They know Gujarati and Hindi.', 'We have worked with lot of ladies and have noticed this in young children. See, what I am going to say is a very small thing, it is about discipline. When ladies come to our Rudra center, they use to chit chat and would talk anything. Children listens to those talks and they also started talking that way. They would talk anything like using abusive words, also when ladies are fooling around with each other mischievously , they would use hands for giving claps to each other or to pat at the back. All these things are going on. So over here children also use to come, as their mothers bring them. So because of that children were also getting influenced. So when we were doing the circle of sharing, this matter has been put forward that “See children are behaving this way, where do they learn it from? What you people are doing here for 3 to 4 hours by chit chatting together, this is what they see.” Then while working with mothers we taught them like this, so then they stopped using those kinds of words. Also we had made one rule for discipline, that nobody should use disrespectful language there. Because you may talk frankly when somebody is your friend.', 'You may use such language, but the child who is seeing this doesn’t know that you can use frank language with friends. So for example if I am calling you in front of the child and say like “You do this”, then the child also will say the same thing that “You do this”. So then we had started doing this way that we started calling each other as Ben, and even if he is a very small child he should be called as brother. Then the child would also learn to respect. Once he grows up he will understand the difference that can I say “Tu” or “Tamey” to my friend or to whom should I say “Tu” or whom should I say “Tamey”. Thus the scenes of respecting others are put in them right from their childhood. So because of that, now the atmosphere has improved a lot.', 'Gujarati.', 'Hindi and Gujarati.', 'They know to properly read and write in Gujarati. But in Gujarati itself there is different forms. Because in Gujarat the are many districts and villages, and according to that the language forms of Gujarati also keep changing and dialect will also change. At there whatever they speak, they can write. Mostly it is like that.', 'What language she speaks?', 'Yes, they have strong voice. They would make them sit by just saying “Come on” and they beat as well.', 'If you see  just before 10 minutes they would be sitting nicely and having tea and after 10 minutes, it would become like a battlefield, with kicking, boxing and foul languages. They speak such a strong foul language.', 'How the people from Surat have the habit of speaking foul language by using bad words, they talk in the same way by using these bad words.', 'Yes, \\xa0they keep speaking \\xa0foul language continuously.', 'No. We should not talk to them in the language in which he is talking. Like if he is talking with temperament, then you should not talk with temperament. If we are not doing that then there will be fight. But when the person is angry, we should smile and talk. When that person is smiling or doing something like that, then at that time we can get little bit angry on them. I use to do like that. At that time I can be angry on that person and can ask that “Do you have any idea about what will you do with these four kids, when you are having scarcity of food at home for them?“', 'Hindi, English & Gujarati', 'All the three.', 'Yes.', 'There is a slight problem with Gujarati.', 'Gujarati.', 'Yes.', 'At home, my father knows all the three languages.', 'Yes.', 'Two languages.', 'They know both the languages.', 'Yes.', 'They understand only Gujarati.', 'Yes, he checks the patients.\\xa0 Like if there is a confirmed fever, then we start the routine treatment,\\xa0like for fever, Analgesic or something like that and then we do the tests. Or sometimes when the patients come with the reports\\xa0directly and it is already diagnosed that he has malaria, then we just have to write the treatment for malaria.\\xa0 Then we will explain it to the patient and will give the print out of the prescription to him. Then sir would explain to the patients that, “You have to take this treatment”. Also, we explain everything in Gujarati. Our prescription is also in the local language like “This medicine should be taken in the morning or in the evening and take the medicine after\\xa0the meal or before the meals”. Also, we tell them orally about the other precautions that has to be taken.  Also secondly, there is a book of diabetes. In the book it is been written that if a diabetic patient is there, then what is to be eaten, what is not to be eaten, which exercise has to be done, what type of food has to be taken, what are the cares to be taken, what happen if diabetes is reduced.\\xa0All those things have been written in that book. “What happen if the diabetes is reduced”, the problems for that is also written. If it reduces too much, then to control that what has to be done. The tablets for that is also written inside. When the patient is coming for the first time, then we will write and give him. Also we keep sugar tablets with it. Then if the person is at home, then he can have anything with that sugar tablet, like lemon juice, or if they are travelling in the bus, then at that time we will not have sugar with us, then he has to keep that tablets in his pocket.\\xa0So, we explain all these things.', 'Yes, and the other medicines are the one which need to be continued regularly. Whereas this one is a temporary medicine. He has to take the other medicines lifelong. So, when he comes again for the routine checkup,\\xa0after one or two months, it will come at that time. But the treatment for diarrhea will be done for now. (Interviewer asking cameraman to zoom out) Then if some local patient is there, who is a Gujarati, then we would give him the print in Gujarati. And if the person is Hindi speaking or a non Gujarati then we give him in his language.', 'We usually use Gujarati, Hindi and English, these three languages. Maximum everything gets fixed in these three languages.', \"Yes, it gives.\\xa0 See, it gives Marathi. That's all, so there are four languages. Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati and English. But according to in which ever area you are. Right now, we are in Gujarat, so Gujarati. Or in which state you are, they will use that language.\", 'Hindi. That is my village language.', 'Only little by little. This girl has taught me a few things. So I know\\xa0a little bit.  If she shows me once that these are the names, then I can do that much.', 'I can read if it comes in Gujarati.', 'Yes, I know two languages.', 'I understand less. Not everything. But my daughter is there, you know.', 'Two. Gujarati and Hindi. I know English, only very less.', 'Gujarati.', 'Actual fight also happens. They would also speak foul languages.', 'Yes, they speak foul languages. They speak like that their wives, to their children. Those things are going on.', 'In our neighborhood nobody speaks foul languages. For us, it is not like that.', 'For us, there is a public toilet. It is there, just nearby.', 'Like the government toilets.', 'Yes, that governments toilet is just next to us. There, one person use to sit. He is from Kathiyawadi. In his mouth, there will be always foul language. He will speak like that to everybody. Even if it is a guest, he does not care. Immediately he would start speaking foul languages. He always speaks using foul language. So, in our Chaul, such things are there too much.', 'Gujarati and Hindi. I can manage Hindi, a little bit.', 'She had taken milk just now.

After that kids of 3 to 6 years old come to our anganwadi. We make them do prayers. Then we have to give them breakfast of Matru Mandal. On Monday and Thursday we have fruits along with snacks. We have menu of Matru Mandal from Monday to Saturday, so we have to give breakfast as per that. So after giving breakfast, a timetable is given to us for different activities from Monday to Saturday and as per that we make the children do those activities.', 'The problem here is mothers don’t have time to take care of kids. So what they do is they give one rupee in hands of kids, because they want to go out for work or do household work. So what they do is they give one rupee to kids and kids buy those one rupee packet of Mamri and Bhungla and eat it. They are very dangerous and the colors used in that are very harmful. Because of that the kids do not get nutrition. Also they eat pepsi, etc. Mothers don’t have time to cook food and feed them. Because of that kids remain malnutritional. They have lot of superstitions like if a child fall sick, they would go to the Bhuva and do Dhora Dhaga, and will not take them to dispensary. Therefore this malnutriotion is seen at high rate in the kids. Because of anganwadi there has come lot of difference. They have came out little from these superstitions and understood that if a child fall sick or if we fall sick, we should take them to dispensary. When we say them, they become immediately ready.', 'No, it has never happened till now. But they say that I will not go alone and we also need to go with them. Then we go along with them and get the work done.', 'Yes, they have lot of financial problems. How they work is like in morning they go for work and the money they bring in the evening is used and finished for that day itself.', 'No, both bring different. Sometimes ladies may or may not be allowed to work.', 'Yes. If she go out and something goes wrong, because of that fear they don’t send. But in our side lot of ladies are going for work. They go for collecting recyclable garbage, some ladies go for job also in offices for doing jobs like cleaning tables or sweeping and cleaning floor. Even girls are going.', 'Suppose you are staying  in this house and you are drinking. And you have other friends and you keep roaming with them without doing any work. And they get influenced by each other’s bad company. Then everybody starts drinking.', 'The ladies will do their work, those who go out for earning may or may not go. It is as per their wish. There are some who have the feeling of responsibility that she have to earn, and they go for earning. Some go for roaming and some will be just standing in groups. Sometimes when we come in the morning there will be many men standing at Galla shops.', 'I cannot decide. Because we see gents also and ladies also. But I feel ladies are working more.', 'Yes, ladies do more work. Because men don’t understand if my child or wife has fallen sick, then it is my responsibility to do help for them. But ladies feel more this way.', 'No , we haven’t seen anybody doing that. Because from morning when they get up, whatever they do is like exercise only. Those who do labor work is like a physical exercise only, but those who live sedater lifestyle, they live that way only. They don’t feel like since they are free, they should do exercise or yoga.', 'Yes, that much only. Nothing extra.', 'Yes. In a year as many programmes comes we do those and we do extra also. In all anganwadis very nice programmes are done.', 'Yes we have realized so.', 'Yes, if you tell with love, then the work will be done nicely. With Vaghri community also, we deal with love. When we talk to them with love we also get the same response.', 'Everything has gone from their house. Money has gone and they had to keep their whole house as guarantee for getting money. They have lot of debts so that they had to keep their house as guarantee for getting money.  In  between the wife and children went to village. In village she is working and he is just lay down here. The earning in the village was not sufficient, so they came back here. The lady have some problem in her kidneys, so we admitted her. We don’t know what will happen now. Physically she is  very sick  and she cannot do hard works. But her daughter has now become around 15 years old. She goes for work in bungalow. Sometimes we support them. If there is some need then we talk to the institutions and they also support them.', 'After 10th ,they have their household responsibilities. If there are house problems then they go for work. So they leave their studies. Or else they will have to take care of their younger siblings and so they leave their studies. And nowadays the atmosphere is not very good, so they don’t allow the girls to go out much, thinking that the girls might go on the wrong path if she goes for studying. They have these feelings, so they don’t allow girls to go out. Sometimes when we have programmes and we want to call them, then we will have to explain to them. Then they send the girls on our responsibility by saying that “Madam, if you take the responsibility, then only I will send my daughter, otherwise I will not send”. Here these problems are also there.', 'No, it is not creating any problem for us. In fact they tell us like “Sister if there is any work, please tell us or if anybody troubles you, inform us”. So in a way they are good, but in a way they are spit fire kind of people. You can’t poke them and only just talk how much ever is necessary.', 'No, we can tell only to ladies. We can talk everything to ladies. With ladies we can speak with our own right. But with gents we also get little scared by thinking that if we tell something and if something goes wrong, then. Like that we also get little scared with gents. But yes, there are some who are regular and we know that if we tell them they would listen to us. We talk to such gents. Then they would do the work.', 'No , they don’t have their own business, everybody do the labor only. Some people go for mason work for buildings, some go for works on the road like cleaning the road.', 'No, many ladies get up early at 5’o clock, go out and collect recyclable materials from garbage. Then they separate plastic ,paper, etc and sell it to raddhie shop. From that money they do their living.', 'Yes.', 'Here when the work of saving money in the bank account was done and lot of ladies were joined. The ladies come to GramShree and do embroidery work and make potleys. They come here to have their own savings. They open a bank account and put money in that. They take our help to create their savings. We were not sure that they will be able to continue and so we gave them their money back.', 'Sahara ?', 'Yes, there is Sahara Bank and one more bank starting with ‘Sa’ only.', 'Yes, they take advantage of that. We have vocational courses in Jeevan Theerthu. They teach different type of courses and help them to get job also. There is an institution called Jeevan Theerthu where these things are going on and these people take advantage of that.', 'Like how in our house we make the kids study, these people are not taking care like checking whether home works are done or not.', 'In everyday life, the issue is that they stay in a joint family and they have houses of one or two rooms. There are 5 to 6 members staying in that space itself. Mother-in-law and father-in-law would be there. Younger or elder brother-in-laws would be there. And they all stay together. Mostly it is like that. Everyone like gents go for their job in the morning and ladies leave their kids and go for work in bungalows. They go for these daily labor jobs. And kids stay with old people who are there at home, like grandparents. Or if there are elder brothers or sisters, then they make them leave their studies and keep them to take care of younger siblings.', 'Yes, for household work. If there is elder sister then they drop her studies after 6th or 7th class, then she has to take care of her younger siblings and parents go for work. If we bring younger siblings to anganwadi, then parents take these girls to bungalows to help them.', 'I am working here since past 11 years.', 'If you come straight on the same road, then 30, OD Marvadi Chaul is there. I work there, in the same area.', 'In this the relationship is strong, but the matter is mother has more feeling for the kids. But the thing is that their fathers have some or the other bad habits or addiction. Here definitely they have addictions. Many a times they drink alcohol and come. Then they beat the woman. So the woman is tired of the entire situation and trying to manage to meet the both ends of the household. While managing this situation of the house, they behave rudely towards kids by saying “Get lost from here, let me do my work”. Because they have to reach on time for doing bungalow work or they have to reach on time to the place where they are doing job and also do the household work. And if husband drinks alcohol and comes home, then they have to bear them also. So by considering all these situations, sometimes they show their anger on their kids. Because she is a lady and she cannot show her anger on any body except her own children. This is what happens.', 'No, the children will see their parents behavior and learn that only. Children come to us and tell us their household matters like “Yesterday my father came home drunk and beaten my mother too much ”. And then we go to meet the mother, as during afternoon we have  to do the house visits for five houses and that time we go and ask them that “Bhabhie, were you have been beaten in this way”. Then she says “Yes, he beats. But then what to do? I cannot go to my mother’s place also and now the kids are also there. Where will I go by leaving the children ?”. They say like this. Because husband goes for work, comes back and goes for drinking. So he is not in his senses. Then how he would take care of the children. So lady bears this much.', 'Yes. Now slowly  and slowly we are seeing the results of our work. But still it will take little more time.', 'Monetarily they earn as good as us. They do much more hard work than us and earn. Like we come here at 9.30 and stay till 3.30 and we earn 4750 rupees monthly as salary. Whereas they go for bungalow work in the morning at 9’O clock and come back home at 3’O clock. Then their wives will earn around 6000 to 7000 monthly doing bungalow work. So they earn much better than us. But still they don’t know how to use that money properly or save it properly.', 'Some people like grandparents who stay at home and take care of kids and house, after daughter-in-law and son go for work, they have little heavy body. Whereas those who work, they have measured body.', 'For parents, fathers get up in the morning, take bath, have breakfast, then they get ready and go for work. Some of them come home to eat in the afternoon. If not, then they take tiffin and go out. In their tiffin they will have roti and Sabji only. They come home in the evening. After coming home they watch TV for some time. Then they sit together for some time. Then if anybody have any addiction, then that person goes out. Then they come home only after having their booze.  And ladies get up in the morning, do little bit of household work, sometimes get the children ready and sometimes they don’t, sometimes they give them bath and sometimes they don’t, and then they leave for doing bungalow work.', 'After coming home they wash cloths, they clean vessels, they clean floor, etc. Then they take rest for some time and then they start work for the evening.', 'Yes, everybody go for work. Hardly 5 to 10 percent people may not be going for work and also having addictions. And their houses are ran by their wives. Even though they work, whatever they get they use for their addictions. And they give only some amount in the house.', 'Yes, many houses are like that also in our area ,that ladies are only going for work. And men are not going for work and they just drink alcohol and keep roaming whole day.', 'Yes, that much can be found. In my area there are many houses where I see like he doesn’t go for work and keep drinking. And they must be working is like in a week 3 days he might go for work and 4 days he just keeps roaming. Then whatever he earns, he just uses it for drinking.', 'Yes, and out of them 2 work in college as office boys and Manoj Bhai works in one grocery shop in Madhupura.  Their family is very nice. Their house girls also are given respect nicely. The Manoj Bhai who works in the Madhupura shop has two daughters and the other Manoj Bhai has two daughters and one son.', 'Yes, if we explain, then slowly and slowly it will make difference. It may not make difference at once. But slowly and slowly they will understand.', 'Then for mother-in-law they will cook with less salt for few days, but then after that it comes back to the same. That means it may work for a few days, but then it comes back to the same previous situation like how they were regular before.', 'Many a times we get that kind of thought. But after doing so much of work for anganwadi and then it is difficult for us to go and explain to them.', 'No, but they say that they do work for our goddesses and it is okay if we give them money. And if we go to dispensary and then if we take medicine and something serious happens to our children, then is the doctor going to save our child.', 'No, we explained to them many a times that you all are drinking alcohol and leave it. Like in a day when the person is not drunk and when we go to their house, then we tell them “See brother, you have such a nice home and you are doing such a nice job, then why are you drinking alcohol. Leave it”. Then he says “No, I cannot stay without drinking alcohol and I have to drink little bit every day mandatorily”. They say like that and so they are not able to leave that.', 'It is like if my this work is done, then I will offer coconut for so much of money or I will do this. But the kind of thing like “I will leave alcohol”, they don’t do. Or “I will leave Gutkha or Miraj”, they will not keep that kind of Mannat.', 'In my area most people are Marwadis. They have wood business.', 'They go to cut the woods or they work in wood workshop. Some people work in glass factory, and others do coloring work also. And the ladies go for bungalow works.', 'In my area very less people go for that. In my  area there is almost nobody. There is one Chaul from where only people of hardly 10 houses do that work. Not more than that.', 'Yes. They go for work in bungalow. Then there are some houses where they have studied till 8th or 9th standard. They go for cooking also.', 'We explain to the parents who come to anganwadi to open one such account and deposit 100 rupees every month through post. So many ladies, who are daughter-in-laws, doing bungalow work deposit 100 or 200 in post office without the knowledge of their mother-in-laws.  And also many people have opened accounts in Manav Sadhna. Here they can do savings of 100 or 300 or 310 and so they have opened accounts like that.', 'Yes. They take advantage of government schemes. But many times they were not having the documents that are required for that. Like many a times they don’t register the birth of their child or sometimes they don’t have their grand parent’s death certificate. So their work get stuck when the account cannot be opened without those documents. Also when their names are not registered in the birth certificate, that also cause problem. Many such things keep happening.', 'Many take their help and many don’t, because they think that the work they do in bungalows are better than the work from the agencies.', 'Suppose if I am going for a work and if there the neighbor needs somebody to do the work, then we would contact other and inform them about this .', 'Gents also search for work in the same way.', 'They do color painting or masonry work.  And if they go for the work of cutting wood, then they would be given 200 or 300 rupees per day.', 'Many people do daily labor and nowadays there are people who do service also.', 'Many work as peon in offices and the young boys who learnt computer do computer related works also. They also do work like book binding in press.', 'Yes.', 'Yes. They just make calls.', 'Yes. They may be able to send messages. Those who are educated and works at good position like peon or something, they know how to message.', 'Yes. But right now I am going for vacation from 21st onwards. My helper lady will come. You will be able to manage little bit with her. If you are coming in my presence, then I can help you out.', 'In municipality, they clean the floor or sit in office.', 'Power house, from where the electricity and light comes. In that also they have work.', \"No, I eat homely food. We have a business of cotton wick, just like a labor only. When I go home I will do this cotton work for 4 or 5 hours. And in the next morning their father will take whatever I had made, to sell. \\xa0Now he does this hockery business in the morning and so he feels hungry, and eats snacks from outside. And after finishing his round, he comes to home at around 2 or 3 o'clock. So after coming home also he would feel hungry  and like that he eat too much of outside food. In the evening also he goes to do the business and takes round. If he feels like to come home and eat, \\xa0he does that.  Otherwise,  suppose when he meets his friends from outside, when used to eat snacks with them also.\", \"In the morning ladies finish their house hold work and go for jobs like cleaning floor at bungalows or for collecting recyclable materials from garbage. There is a court near Lal Darwaja where many ladies go for cleaning floor. They go there at 8 o'clock and come back at 12 o'clock. After coming back they do household works. And old people will sit together and do spiritual songs. Here in Manav Seva they play these spiritual songs. They go for spiritual songs in the evening for about one hour. The ladies have been given prayer beads also and therefore in the evening all ladies will go there and sit together to take god’s name with those prayer beads. They also take care of their grandchildren.\", 'There is a lady opposite to our house who is very poor. Her husband use to drink alcohol with all the money that he has earned from his work. He would not give money even for cooking. She had one son and three daughters. She herself was limping on her legs. He doesn’t even allow her to go out anywhere. If she goes out then the husband would show doubt on her saying that you are going out to do something bad. So he would not allow his wife to go out and they raise their children with lots of difficulty. She had three daughters and one son. Two daughters have got married and one daughter is still unmarried. The son has become 25 years old, but the son has learnt only whatever his father was doing.', 'Yes, but there are 4 or 5 houses in the lower area where there is little bit of problems. They go to collect papers from the garbage. Sometimes they collect in the morning or sometimes they do that work whole night. In morning they separate the materials, then they sell it and have food with whatever money they had got out from selling that. There are 4 or 5 houses like that. And on the upper area there are well living people. They do labor or jobs. But they are normal people.', 'Yeah, we go to explain to them. But as we are helpers, we don’t go that much. As helpers, we have to call the children, clean the floors and make snacks. Our time goes in that. Whereas the worker ladies get more time. So when we are making the breakfast in the morning, they used to go for a round. At that time day come to know more about these things. They know about the situations in each house and they explain to them also. Then at the time when we leave the kids at around 2.00 or 2.30, \\xa0at that time also they have to go for house visits for 1 hour. So they know more about it, because when they are going for one hour they do all the inquiries.', 'Yes, They are with us for 3 or 4 hours and the rest of the time their mother take care of them. Whereas fathers go for work in the morning and comes back as tired and so he goes to sleep. Even if mothers are going for work, after 2 to 3 hours she comes back. Those who are going for doing work in bungalows, they come back in 2 to 3 hours. And after coming back they are with children.', 'See, if somebody have some work then they will help even if it is small. They will help out each other.', 'Yes. We help them to cure TB completely. When it is in my hands, it has never happened like the TB has not got cured. Since I have work to do and need to come to anganwadi in the morning, I myself go to their house and give them medicine in evening. Those persons could be gents, ladies, old lady or uncle. I give them medicine myself and once they consume it, then only I use to go home. It is a course of 6 months.', 'Yes. The worker madam goes.', 'Yes, she goes.', \"Yes. They think that if they don't do, then Bharti Ben will tell something to them. So they do work for some time.\", 'If they have some work, then they will do.', 'I told you. Some may reply.', 'They say like even if I work so much, my mother-in-law taunts me. But the other person cannot solve it by talking to the mother-in-law. If they go and talk about it to the mother-in-law, then it will lead to more problems. So they just listen to the daughter-in-law, since they cannot do anything.', 'When they come back to their sense, then they go for work and earn. And again they  drink alcohol and would sleep.', 'They go for work without informing their husbands. They go for house cleaning works.', 'See there are some ladies like that.', 'No. I used to work with Meenakshi Ben. I was transferred to here. It has been 4 to 5 years now in Gandhari Jari.', 'I have to come in the morning .', 'There are two sisters. One worker sister and one helper sister. The worker sister is like a teacher. She makes everybody to do activities. And we have to make snacks.', 'Yes. We have to take care of that many. Also since it is summer holidays for 15 days she had taken summer holiday and when she comes back I will go for leave. But Anganwadi will be working .', 'Yes, I had passed 10th. But before our children were very small and so we could not go out. Then children grew up. \\xa0Then I got this job. Then for what about small amount I get, I finish my household work and come here.', 'Here there is a Vadyari community, \\xa0those people cook only once in a day. In morning they have breakfast or snacks. And in the evening when they reach home after doing their work, \\xa0they cook.', 'yes,  they do work. The things which are sold in festivals, those things they make in the house. They make things like balloons or flutes and then they go and sell themselves.', 'Children are still studying, \\xa0everyone.', 'Before I had a good body, \\xa0but now I have a lot of work to do at home and then I do work here .So I have body like this. But before I had good body.', 'No, \\xa0I like it like this only. It is easy to roam about and everything is good. And if we are fat then we cannot do the work also. So I like my body like this only.', \"Yes. And if somebody is small and fat, \\xa0then they cannot do work also. My husband younger brother's wife is like that.\", 'yes, I am elder to her, \\xa0but I do all the work.', 'Full day they do household work and in the afternoon they go to sleep.', 'Yes, \\xa0ladies. Right now they go for work at \\xa0bungalow, then they do household work. Some of them go to offices also. Now nobody stays idle. Everybody goes for work.', 'In offices there will be people working like cleaning the floors and all like an office boy. That kind of work.', \"We don't do exercise. \\xa0My exercise is automatically done while I am working.\", \"In our neighbourhood, nobody even understand about that. They don't even study. If they fail in 10th standard, \\xa0then they make them do household work.  They don't make them study.  They just keep roaming about.\", 'They have to do like pendulum swing for transferring the materials from one place to other in the afternoon hot sun. They have to go for collecting the recyclable materials from the garbage. They go at night and come back in the morning.', 'See these people go in the neighborhood know, then if somebody wants a maid, then they would inform these people about that. So if one person is searching for work then they keep getting the work like this, by informing one another.', 'See, there is a square where the people doing masonry work stands.', 'People used to stand there in Amba Nagar to get work. So like that if people stands there they get work like transferring materials and all. \\xa0They get the job like this.', 'Masonry work, \\xa0they go for collecting recyclable materials from garbage, \\xa0pedaling rickshaws. Here in this area everybody do these.', 'Yes, \\xa0Here everybody know all these works. Those people who are staying nearby, \\xa0they teach them also.  They take those people along with them for whatever work they are doing. And then they do the work according to the interest they have in.', 'There is a lot nowadays for doing masonry work.', '200 or 250. \\xa0And for the skilled workers they use to get 500-600 also.', 'Yes, \\xa0there are many skilled workers.', \"No, \\xa0everybody  don't have the skill. Everybody may not know the works like the construction of wall and all. They just help the skilled workers. \\xa0They work like that.\", 'Yes, \\xa0they  go. They go for lifting the cement, \\xa0lifting the sand. So like that ladies also go for doing masonry work. A few ladies go.', 'Yes, \\xa0they also stand at that place. Then it is like, when they get a work which will go on for one week or 15 days, then that much time is past. Then, they get another work. Since they are going like this, \\xa0they keep getting work.', \"No, \\xa0they don't take such help. But \\xa0there are some ladies who are not able to manage this kind of work. Then only, \\xa0for example, recently there was a lady who is a widow and who goes to an office where they got good salary and help them get office job or bungalow job. And it was close by to their house. Like that one lady is going from here.\", 'Manav Sadhna helps a lot. Here there is a place called Rudra from Manav Sadhna, \\xa0there they teach embroidery and stitching to ladies. Also there is a pittahere, so from there they take the materials from them. So they have kept many ladies there for work.', \"The reason maybe the parents don't have time from their work. They don't come out of their work and and they cannot take care of their children. So they keep playing whole day or roaming around. So they fail and once they fail there at home. They are not interested in studying.\", \"Yes, \\xa0parents only say them to not to go. They don't send. \\xa0They will say like there are work and so you do the work. The study little bit and after that they make them do the household work. For the girls it is done this way.\", \"No, \\xa0not for earning money from outside. They make them do household work. They don't send girls for doing outside work also. Nobody sends.\", \"Yes, \\xa0for doing household work. Also they haven't studied much, \\xa0like they had studied till 6th or 7th or 8th or 9th, and then they make them sit at home. They make them do household work and get them married at a very young age.\", 'What will they do. \\xa0Poor ladies,  they do the work. They do all job.', 'We have to go to call these kids. If they have not come, then we have to go and call them. We must go there in those areas after finishing our work. And if the child is small, then in the afternoon we have to go to drop them also.', 'Yes, \\xa0because in the beginning their father earn money and give in the house or may not give in the house. But children do hard work and do support also. They say like “ You are our mother know”.', 'I had suffered a lot because he used to drink alcohol and eat non vegetarian food. So at first he spent everything for drinking alcohol and eating non vegetarian food. Then he became physically sick. I had good number of children so after that I had worked a lot. So I had suffered. \\xa0And therefore I need my children to get good education. So that they will get good future.', 'Yes, \\xa0that worker lady and also there is Nita Ben know. So sometimes if we tell them when we need money, they will help. She had given me money like that once. Yes, \\xa0so they give if we need money.', \"Yes, \\xa0they come.  We tell them to not to bear wrong things and do hard work. Whatever is the situation, \\xa0if we are not doing anything wrong you don't have to bear anything wrong. Don't depend on your husband. \\xa0If they are good,  they are earning and giving the money, it is okay. Otherwise you can go out.  Here there is so many controls over them. They don't allow them to go out. \\xa0Even I was not allowed to go out. But then I fought  and I am doing this job since 10 to 11 years. Before they were not allowing me to do the job also. So I always tell them that you should go out, then you will get knowledge.\", 'No we also talk to them about our sorrows about how much we suffered. So you try to bear and do hard work. Then God will take care of you. \\xa0We give them advice like this.', 'Yes, \\xa0about life insurance. There is Raman Bhai here, who do this kind of work of insurance. So we have got insurance. \\xa0And also all the ladies have done the insurance.', \"No, we only go only if there is some work. Otherwise nobody goes to visit anybody's house.\", \"In the afternoon there will be a gap. We have lunch time from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock, and therefore during that time hardly someone comes. It is very scorching sun from 2 to 3, so people would take rest or nap at home or do their own work . And so that there will be a gap in the afternoon. For 2 hours, \\xa0from 3 to 5 there will be more rush.\", 'Yes. We live together. And sometimes if he leaves early then I come by bus or auto till MS. If there is any work at MS then there is a shortcut road from fields to come here.', 'They give a salary but it is very less. It is almost like doing free service, as it is vary less. Like if we are working outside, \\xa0then we will get 10, 15 or 20 thousand as salary.', \"Yes, \\xa0I had done graduation. So \\xa0if I am doing any job outside, \\xa0then easily I would be getting salary of 10 or 11 thousand easily. But here I had joined for a salary of only 2500. My mother's house was very near to Gandhi Ashram of nearly 5 minutes distance and no need of transportation. I thought like I had got an opportunity to do service for the people and so I have accepted the offer with whatever they gave. After joining here I had got many opportunities to do service for the people. We had provided service when there was flood in Uttarakhand. We were there for 15 to 20 days and helped them. So we got such lot of opportunities to do service for people. My husband is being attached with the institution for 15 to 20 years right from his childhood. So we got opportunities to work together. There is a new project in this center that is been started for one year.\", 'Yes. Now it is been 6 months since it started. But the background works, like survey, \\xa0checking how the ladies are managing or how could we help them, were going on for the last one year. We used to take care of such small or big things right from the beginning. We used to go for surveys for ladies for understanding how could we be helpful to them. So we did a lot of work like that. Ashiq Bhai also did lot of survey. There is a one institute called Swachh in Pune which is doing same kind of work. We have visited that place for one week. But there it was different and here it is a little bit different.', \"The government gives them things like handcart or pedal rickshaw. So they don't have to go by walking. They also provide things like dustbins, hand coat, gloves and all. They have that coat of Swachh. They provide these things. There are also some wet garbage like vegetables which doesn't get recycled. So this ladies need to pick those garbage \\xa0and doesn't pick plastic bags, bottles, etc. So this ladies do that kind of work. We came to know lot of things after going there. After coming here I started doing whatever I can do for these ladies.\", 'Here the small age girls of 18 to 20 years old, who have come here after being got married, know that it in their houses the work of collecting papers from garbage are going on. So they also have to go for that. If they cannot go out since they have come from a good family and feel shy doing that work, then they would do the work of sorting those materials at home. And the in laws will go out for collecting the materials like papers and all from the garbage. So like that they share the work. So there is hardly 10 to 15 percentage of ladies who are around 18 to 20 years old. Rest all are above 30 or 40 years.', 'Those people are doing masonry work.', \"They are from this community only. \\xa0They don't know any other work and they are also on labor. My father-in-law also do this work only. He goes for construction work. For them one place is decided where everyone gathers and from there the contractor comes and take to the site. He knows about which one can do which work. Then after that they will leave them back at the same place in the evening and give the labor charges for the day.\", 'Daily basis. They go in the morning and come back in the evening.', 'It is 300 rupees per day for those who are doing labor work. And for craftsman, who knows how to take measurements, who knows everything and orders everything, gets 700 rupees as labor charge per day.', 'No, they don’t know. They can do masonry work, but in such a big community there are hardly 5 to 7 people who do these work. They also feel lazy doing that work as well.', 'No, they don’t want to work.', 'When you get down from Gangeshwar to here, there is Dandi Bridge. Then there is the Silver Cloud building near to which there is an area called Khadol. The majority of people in that area do the plumbing and construction work only. So all those people would go there. If you go little ahead from there, in Vadaj also there is a big community who do this work.  In the whole Tekra area there is staying about 8000 to 9000 people who do this work. Also if you cross the road from there to the opposite side, there also the population is of this kind only. It is all labor, but not luxury area. So everybody does this work only.', \"They themselves don't want to study and also parents force them to help for doing their work in the house.\", 'Not in getting the income. \\xa0They need to help them in doing the household work, like if mother goes out to collect the road side waste then who will do the cooking at home, who will take care of their younger brothers or sisters . So 5th or 6th standard girls would do this work.', 'They take care of their kids but most of them have a feeling that my child will not be going anywhere. So they will do their work and mostly kids will be roaming outside.', 'Gents would help. But mostly they would not be at home or they may drink alcohol and sleep. They will not be in their senses or they may go for gambling. Most of them will be working outside and come back in evening only. So they may not be able to do much for old people.', 'No. Most husbands and wives take care for each other. Like when they want to take them anywhere or go out for shopping or work or if there is any ceremony in a house to where she wants to go, then he would help his wife.', 'There is no such thing that I remember. Because I have recently joined this community. Because mostly all children convince their parents as parents know that their children will not go out too much. If there is tour, then what we do is we make a certificate and when the mothers come here we will ask them everything and then only we will decide, whether the fee is to be paid or not to be paid.  Many times we pay the fees, because we know that they can’t pay. It will be hardly minimum 100 rupees. They read everything or if they don’t know how to read, then we will read and make them listen everything and only if they are convinced we will take their signature. So mostly there is no such context where children would answer back.  Yes but sometimes it happens like if the kids saw some thing with their friend, then they also want that and they ask their parents. But parents will convince them about their situation and would say to share the thing or would say like “We cannot buy that now. But if it is possible, then I would do it after collecting more money for that”. So mostly children would not counter back. If there is a bigger younger generation, then they also do some work like taking one round , helping some one in a work, help in construction work and all, so they might also get 100 to 200 rupees. And they would buy whatever they want from that. So there is less fight between parents and kids.', 'Yes. There are leaders over here. Like here in community center there is a person called Raju Bhai. He is born and brought up in Tekra only. He helps lot of community centers also. He has been the coordinator also. If we wants to send some message to ladies or gents here, then if Raju Bhai says, everyone will agree. They look up to him as a good person. He supports them in everything like in sickness, marriages, death or if people want to gather together and there is no place for that. See at many places there are small streets and there will not be space for conducting marriages. Like that if someone’s death has occurred, then there will not be space for the people to go and sit. So this community center is made for that purpose also. If people from this community need help like that, then we help them by giving the place. So if Raju Bhai says, then they would listen to him.', \"Gents haven't tried even to do exercise, \\xa0since they are having the feeling that they are doing the physical work. In the morning they get up, \\xa0take bath  and leave the house. Also ladies don't get time. There are many ladies who have problems and \\xa0they do. They do some small exercises only if they are advised by the doctor. Rest of them, nobody does. Even if we are explaining to them, they say like they don't have time. Then what can we do.\", 'They go little far also of around 7 to 8 kilometers or 10 kilometers. Also they have it decided that when those people are going to such an area, they will do the work without causing any fight. If the friends are going together, then they would decide that whatever they are getting from this area will be divided equally and take. Like that everybody goes in different areas like CGO area, Navrangpura, Naranpura, Vadaj, Usmanpura, income tax and on this side there is Sabarmati, Ankur, Akhbar Nagar, Subhash bridge, then there are different societies, many go in hotels also and many go to party places so that they can find lot of things from there . Like that there are so many places that they distribute among themselves. As they are staying near to each other, they know that this lady will be going in a certain area and therefore I should go in another area.', \"No, NGOs \\xa0don't contact us. \\xa0But when there are buildings under construction or when AUDA is constructing buildings, there is many big construction people who receives contracts from them to bring so many people and they take only commission .So then as you saw at Akhbar Nagar, they gather at one place.\", \"You can't call it agency, \\xa0maybe you can call it agents because they know that here people gather together. One such place is Akbar Nagar, in Nava Vadaj also there is such a place where people gather together. So if there is any plumbing work, construction work or any other small labor work, then they would come there. And if they know any person who is capable, since they meet there daily, then they will take them in one tempo or any vehicle and in the evening they bring them back at the same place.\", 'Yes, there are many children like that. For example, \\xa0here the computer classes are going on. So there are many children who has completed 10th or 12th and then done computer courses. So the people from call centers or typing or data entry might come here and give offer. Recently there was an offer from Pepsi that they need people to do data entry job. They had criteria like the person should be above 18 years old and should be knowing computer. Then they had done one entire session for training. And from the entire Thekra they had collected all the boys who had passed 12th and who know computer and then provided training for them. And if they feel like they have passed, they give them the offer mentioning that this is the job that you have to do and this is the salary. Therefore we keep these kind of camps, \\xa0so that they can get jobs. Then as you told if a girl is studying nicely and if she needs,  then there is a sister organization of Manav Sadhna called Gramshree, where they handover the work like embroidery and all. So we tell them to go there and show your performance and if they feel like you are capable then they may absorb you. These are the things that are going on.', 'Yeah, very less people are like that. Because many a times Manav Sadhna has done a lot of help for this people. So everybody knows about what kind of work Manav Sadhna is doing and for what they are doing. They are doing it for us only, know.', 'Recently there has started a new NGO called Jeevan Theerth. It is been started to 23 years back. The lady who is the trustee, who was doing the Manav Sadhna work only, is taking care of this center. But she left because of some problems that she had and started her own. She is also doing only service like us.', 'Some might pay.', 'Here everybody has their fixed places like they know they have to go a certain place for job. Many people’s jobs are fixed, like they have to go to this place every day. But there are some people who have talent but don’t have jobs. So those people can pay the money. Most people will not put money on such thing.', 'Yes. That is right. If not that, they will get something else. And if they don’t get, then they will return home. They will not be having the feeling that “I haven’t got work today, so how will I manage” .', 'Then that might work.', 'No, they celebrate as they can. During Holi, Diwali they visit each other’s place. Some may go to their village if they want to do so and if there is any other work to be done, they would do that also.', 'No. there are other people who don’t know how to write and read, as they were not sent to the school right from the childhood and they might not be able to read and write.  Suppose if they are staying in a village, then they are not sent to school and only do house hold works.', 'It might be happened like they might have come from U.P in search of work. Initially they know Hindi only and after staying around Gujarati people, they might have learnt Gujarati also.', 'Majority of them are self-employed.', 'No. There are many ladies who go and work in somebody’s houses and bungalows for doing works like cleaning floor and vessels.', 'Ladies do the work of picking papers, go to bungalows, floor cleaning in showrooms or go to dispensary where there is the need of cleaning the floors. If somebody is educated then they do job at some places.', 'He doesn’t like these things but he has a lot of information. He knows each and every person of this Tekra. So if you want you should ask him somehow.', 'Do you mean in Manav Sadhna? For \\xa04 years.', 'Recording database.', 'Mostly here the main person in the house, which is gents, do labor jobs. And ladies do household work in bungalows. And in the night they do the work of picking paper materials from garbage. In the daytime they sort those materials and sell it off. And the gents who comes in the evening would have already used 50 percent of what he has earned for the day, either for drinking alcohol or for something else.', 'Yes, they do go for work.', 'No, they don’t use it for that. Mostly it is labor work over here. They get more income in doing labor than doing other jobs.', 'Only a few of them work.', 'Yes. If it comes to them on their own.', 'In their community or caste there are some groups going on with a leader. So if leader is explaining to them, then things may work.', 'No, nobody is like that.', 'A few people go on contract basis for building work. Then another work done is cylinder service.', 'Yes, those gas cylinders, they work in that. And some are running Tempo vehicles like mini truck. Also there is another labor work of picking paper from garbage. Like the one which is there outside, people use to do the work of doing rounds with pedal rickshaw. For that they say the price per bag, so they decide like for one trip they would carry this much of luggage and this much money should be given. Also there are some who keeps roaming. Suppose if you are going to Jamalpur, Kalupur or Lal Darwaja, they will be standing there for lifting and transferring the luggage of the people.', 'See it is like suppose a person is running pedal rickshaw. He rides the pedal rickshaw at night and pick papers from the garbage in the night. In the morning he sells off those material. He sells the materials of around 1000 rupees, so he doesn’t have the need to work during daytime. Even I don’t earn that much every day.', 'Mostly for LPG gas transportation it is already allocated.', 'For collecting papers from garbage also, it is allocated. And for some people there are allocated shops for collecting waste materials. For some people the dispensaries are also allocated like they have to transport whatever the waste materials are there from the dispensaries. Then there are people who work on contract basis. For them also the timing is fixed. The remaining local people would be there at Jamalpur or Kalupur.', 'No, only a few people, like 20 percent, need to search for work. Rest 80 percent people have fixed work.', \"Those people have to reach to that place in morning between 8 o'clock to 9 o'clock.

They want less work, but more money which is not possible.', \"Lot of schemes come. \\xa0But these people don't use them.\", \"They are doing labor work and get more income by doing that over here. So they don't want to pay attention on anything else.\", 'No, it is not like that. It is only for a few. Those who do the work of rag picking have the habit of purchasing things for every day.', 'Everybody is busy in doing their labor work right from the morning. Because for some labor work they have to reach around 8’o clock  in the morning from their house and in evening they come home being tired and so they drink alcohol and go to sleep .', 'Yes, they do.', 'At that time when they are told they would listen, but after that they will not adhere to. There are very few.', 'For calling and SMS, everyone is using Uninore', 'Grandparents are always free. They get up in the morning , freshen up, have tea and breakfast and then go back to sleep. Then, get up at the time of lunch. They have their lunch and would go back to sleep. In the evening, they get up and visit to anybody’s house in the nearby place to just sit there. And ladies in the house also have this kind of schedule only. In morning they would get up early, they have to make tea and breakfast and serve. Then they have household work. Then would make lunch and then in the afternoon they are free. They might go to sleep and in the evening  would get up and go to do their regular work.', '50% of them don’t go for work.', 'Yes, ladies. There are only some who go for work.', 'All of them go for work.', 'Yes. Those who are married would go. Those who are unmarried and are not going to school, keep roaming the whole day.', 'Yes, it is possible, because many of them are working in Torrent or many are electricians. So, they know how to do.', 'I have joined with Manav Sadhna many years back, in the years 2003 and 2004. And for one and half years I am working voluntarily with Manav Sadhna and from there I got lot of support from Anaar Dhidhi. So by doing all that I have worked with almost all NGOs. And now, I’m working with Rudra Center. My journey is now 10 to 12 years old.', 'Yes, now I’m working here as a worker.', 'Right now, there is a social part of our Gramshree organization called Rudhra Mahila Udhar Kendra. I’m mainly attached there working for ladies where we give training of embroideries, weaving and we make them do yoga. We work on health issues and I’m working with that. There are 2 to 3 other works also. Like right now, we have a collaboration with Stanford University in which we are working on how to impart value based education to people. Also whenever we sit in a group discussion, mostly people don’t talk much about money. They say our research is going on. We are working on it for last 5 to 7 years on this and in that most of the people focus on the fact that only values help for the betterment of the world. We can earn money anyhow. But when the one who has money is supporting the other and the other person is supporting the next, like that people can be helpful to each other to make them stand on their own. But the most needed thing for this world is value based education. So how do we share that way each other and also one person can’t do everything. But if each person thinks for the betterment of the world and thinks that what is my statement in that, like what is that I want to do for the betterment of the world and how to do that. And like this we can take humanity forward. We are doing research on that. So, we are working on that one project and that has a part called Swa Gang in which there are three people from here and three people from there. They are either students or professors amongst us. We have a project which is a course of 10 months where we have to do our own journey. Also, we are working with young girls those who are teenagers from the age of 13 to 19. They have lot of problems. Many a times they have become overconfident, after we have taught them self-defense and sometimes that also becomes a problem. So, we want a kind of curriculum to be developed, where there is a combination of value as well as physical training. Because here, we are working for betterment of ladies and that doesn’t mean that we become anti-men. We don’t want to put any such thing to their mind at all. So right now, all these things like these works and these projects are in progress. So this is what going on.', 'Yes, because I have been brought up there, know. I was born and brought up there. And that is one of the reasons why I chose to do this work. Because my attention is always on the way of approach, like whatever things are happening, in that what is our approach to look at it and how do we think about it. And our entire life is running on that. So, I feel like the society is carrying the problems or the customs  which are not good and if good thoughts are developing in me, then why shouldn’t I share it with the society. I don’t have expectations that the society will change or the people will change. But I need my own satisfaction that at least I have tried and not like eating, drinking, and finishing the life only for myself. When I am taking my last breath I need the satisfaction that in my life I had given some contribution to the world and not like only lived for myself.', 'Because, this is my observation that I’m not giving a general statement, that in whatever I have seen, gents use to go in the morning, earn and come back in the evening. When everything is ready, they eat and sleep. And some of them would be socializing. But it is very practical in ladies, as they think a lot about future. If you focus on negative points then there will be lot of practical side also. Suppose you are staying in a joint family and if there is one lady who talks with negative energy. But behind that their thought will be about the security of their child like “If my husband is only working hard and is spending behind somebody else then what is my security?”. That keeps going on in her mind. So you can see this situation in positive way also. She is not wrong in her feelings but only her way of expression is different.', 'So, they are busy in earning. They go in the morning, do the labor work and they have their own social commitments. That is also going on. So how much ever they tell their children, at the end they feel that if they are not listening what can I do. So they give up very easily.', 'We have worked with lot of ladies and have noticed this in young children. See, what I am going to say is a very small thing, it is about discipline. When ladies come to our Rudra center, they use to chit chat and would talk anything. Children listens to those talks and they also started talking that way. They would talk anything like using abusive words, also when ladies are fooling around with each other mischievously , they would use hands for giving claps to each other or to pat at the back. All these things are going on. So over here children also use to come, as their mothers bring them. So because of that children were also getting influenced. So when we were doing the circle of sharing, this matter has been put forward that “See children are behaving this way, where do they learn it from? What you people are doing here for 3 to 4 hours by chit chatting together, this is what they see.” Then while working with mothers we taught them like this, so then they stopped using those kinds of words. Also we had made one rule for discipline, that nobody should use disrespectful language there. Because you may talk frankly when somebody is your friend.', 'Yes, then they will change. The problem is in parenting. Parenting is a very big reason for the problem of differentiation between girls and boys. Society comes later. Parents tell in the house itself that boys can do this and girls can do that. So the brother will eat and keep the vessels and would tell the sister that “You wash”. Then girl will always have the question that why she has to wash? Then she will be made silenced by saying that “You have to wash it and this is your job and not your brother’s job. It’s your work my child”. They teach them like this adoringly.', 'It starts from there. Therefore it is very important to start the work from parenting itself. Yes, there are a lot of projects in progress in that as well. Like how there are classes for girls about adolescence, we are going to start like that for boys as well.', 'Yes, there causes problem because many times comparison is done that this is mother-in-law and that is daughter-in-law, it comes from both sides. Many times daughter-in-law would not understand the situation of mother-in-law and also mother-in-law would not understand the situation of daughter-in-law. We have a lady over here and her delivery was on due. When the baby came, the mother-in-law went to stay with her elder daughter-in-law. When the lady got into a condition to be able to work, mother-in-law stayed with her. She is a rag picker. This lady has one elder son who is 5 or 6 years old. Recently she gave birth to another boy. That boy was born at the time of Diwali. So he is 4 to 6 months old. So the lady actually is in need of her mother-in-law. But she shifted to other place.', 'Now the situation has improved a lot because employment has increased and somehow they use to get work. There are many families who have shifted from their state and are staying over here. In the initial stage they had problem of getting meals. But those who are staying here for years manage their food somehow, like the ladies who come to Rudra, they don’t do just Rudra work. For example they would be running a stitching machine at home or they would do work for 5 or 10 rupees for somebody. So their expense will be managed by that. Like that now the intensity of starving has reduced. Otherwise there were so many families who used to have food in the morning and don’t know what they would have in the evening.', 'Yes, because they do a lot of work. In the full day they have to walk.', 'But we have to really work hard for that. Because they have these understanding that doing these exercises are helpful for the body. But they say like “We do these whole day and we go to sleep immediately as we go to bed because in full day we are doing so much of work and our body is paining. We are getting that much tired. Then why are we doing exercises”. They know it like that only. They have only a little understanding about doing things properly, following rules and therefore their mind is not allowing them for accepting that. So this area needs to be worked on.', 'They have this feeling that they are doing so much of work and so we are tired and it is more than enough.', 'Because they have struggle every day. They have to work hard for everything. So they will feel like “Rather than giving one hour over here, if I am going out and work there for one hour, then I will get money. Then I can eat food with that money. My children can study with that money. I can buy clothes with that money. I can manage my social commitments with that money”. So they have this kind of mentality at all levels, it can be more or less. So still explaining this is in process.', 'It is very difficult with males, because they too much of ego. We are trying to work on it. But they have this feeling that they are doing the most work that is there in the world. Whereas wives are doing full day, as they go out and do labor work and come. Still they have this kind of expectation from them that “When I come home, you have to serve food to me. You should be available at home. You finish the entire household work and then sleep ”. It is like that. When they finish their work and come home, they would not do anything. A glass of water also need to be given into their hands. There are only a very few husbands who help their wives or support them in everything. Even if they cannot help in their work, at least they will give mental support like “Okay, I am there with you”. There are very few like that.', 'Are you asking about husbands? In them everyone do different occupations. Some do labor, they drive pedal rickshaw or do government jobs.', 'There are officers in government jobs. Some work in banks. Some work in Torrent company, which is the electricity company.', 'For them, I don’t have any idea about their internal work. And so I cannot tell you the posts.', 'Majority of people.', 'Yes.', \"That is there in some special community people. \\xa0I don't want to take the name of that community. In that community, gents use to dominate in the house. But they drink alcohol and keep laying. Wives go for earning and manage the house. There is a community like that.\", 'No, \\xa0weavers do weaving work. And they are all from different communities, but stay together. If you see, \\xa0then the most progressive community is the weavers community. Because there is very less addiction in their community and there is more of education. They try to understand the lifestyle in a much better way. We have done a survey and have seen that the people of that community is very progressive.', 'For that you can take a walk in the community and meet 4 to 5 people. Then you will get an idea. If you feel like that these people look like backward, then talk to them. Like how you are talking to me and I am giving you information, like that they will also give you information. Because you have the skill of doing the work by asking questions.', 'I am giving you the essence. But I want you to do little work also.', 'Work for that, \\xa0because I am giving you information from my perception according to what I believe. But if you are meeting 4 to 5 people on your way, then it will be much better, because it is about the whole community. It is about labelling them.', \"Here they have their internal dealings going on. This is also one of the reason for why the change is not coming. Who will help you at the time of need? \\xa0Who will give loan to an outside poor person? So what they would do is,  internally they have their leader in their community, those who have big names and  who are important people. They take loan from such people. Since they have taken loan, \\xa0they come under other’s obligation. So whatever tradition those people would tell,  these people need to follow them. So there are some people who somehow,  I don't know how, earn a lot of money. There are people who do so much of hard work and is not able see money. Whereas these people earn by just sitting itself. Only god knows how these people are earning. But they take loan from these people.\", 'They get it through each other.', 'Yes, \\xa0everybody would take care of that person saying that “See here, this place is here. You go there” or ”Meet these people”. So they connect socially and they get small or big work. They also have this desperation that I have to eat by earning myself. So this is very strong and positive thing that they have. So they finds their own means for earning themselves.', \"They have slowly started trusting those NGOs who are working for so many years in that particular area , like Gramshree, ESI and Manav Sadhna which are working there for 20 to 22 years. But still you can't say that it is a blind trust. They think 10 times before doing anything.\", 'There is one Institute called Seva, which is working there. Then there is one Jeevan Theerth institution, which is also working there.', \"No, they have started just recently. Seva Sanstha is very old. And I don't want to discuss that aspects. I don't want it to be recorded. But all the other institutions are new. Manav Sadhna is working since 22 years and it is a constant work that they have done. These institutions like Manav Sadhna, ESI or Gramshree are not just about talking or only on paper. It is there on paper and in talks, but there is a practical aspect of that also. There is a practical hand that we are using and it is not like we just talk and forgotten it. If you see over here, there would be generations who had sacrificed for this. There have been for generations. \\xa0Gandhiji , then after that his followers took it up, Eashwar Dhadha and after him Jayesh Bhai and after that there are people like us.\", 'They are working from generation to generation.', 'We are working, but it is not like we want grants or donations and so we write good proposals on paper, make websites or take interviews and publishes and ask them to give the money. It is not like that. Here we work first and people can see that work. If people feel like to give us money, then they can give. Or if they want to give grant or donation, then they give. Otherwise people are busy over here in helping, by putting their best foot forward. No one has even the slightest thought for cheating somebody.', 'There may be differences in opinions between trustees and workers. And as they are human beings, it is not necessary that they get along with everybody. But when it comes to work that we want to work for the betterment of the society, then everyone is like a pearl in the same string.', 'They have seen the work.', \"There they haven't seen like speaking good talks and running away when the actual work comes. We have walked in muds and done the work. We have cleaned gutters. We have cleaned toilets. We have given birth to unkempt and dirty children. We have cleaned their private parts, cleaned their noses without any aversion. Not like doing work with a spoilt face. Two to three generations have worked with medications and have given all the sacrifices. They have seen 3 to 4 generations who had given everything in this and the new children are also joining in this. So even this generation is there. That is how the trust is built.\", \"I don't know about that. We have not worked on that to know why they are not declaring.\", 'The quantity of sugar is more. It is mostly in tea. The rate of drinking tea is very high in the area, where I am staying and working currently.', \"See they know everything. But what they say “Live your life”, this is the common answer that everybody gives. We also have worked on the cases of addictions for people drinking alcohol, for people eating Gutkha and for people getting TB. For providing awareness about that, we have done work. We have done drama in Chauls, but they have only one answer that “Anyhow we are going to die, then why like to do something or not to do something. Why to live like that? In hospitals we have seen many people like even when they don't have any addictions, they have got mouth cancer.” So they tell like “You don’t try to explain to us. Let us do what we are doing”. There is lot of people who have this kind of mindset.\", \"Yes, because 2 to 3 generations used to stay together. You won't believe that before for doing the vaccination for kids of five years, they use to come to verge of crying. Why don’t these people understand that it is important to do vaccination, it is important to do polio dosages, because the older generation would say “Don’t you see your father. We have not given vaccination to him. Still he is alive and walking know. Nothing has happened to him and you keep pushing injections into the body. You are making holes in the body”. They say like that.\", 'See, when we are considering a camp, for how many days the camp will be there? So they respond to camps.', 'When it comes to applying in their daily life, they fall weak. Because their life is full of running around and have ten types of tensions like husband is there, children are there, we have to earn, we have to take care of house or we have to clean the house. They have all these things, so how to obtain time from this. Also they want to have their entertainment. See where we grew up, what is the thing for the entertainment in their lives ? It is TV, right. Except that what is there for the entertainment ? May be sometimes, once in a year if we can afford and if we have money in our pocket, then we go to our own village and roam about. We have never been to our village. So one of the way to entertain is that to go to the village and roam about. There is no other kinds of entertainment in our lives. And we celebrate festivals. Otherwise the things like going for movies, picnic or a long trip are never there. They find it very easy to get entertainment from the TV by listening to songs, watching movies or just watching TV. So they find it right to put their time in that. Because they are working for the whole day and they feels like that they need to sit together at least for sometimes. So they feel that also as an extra work for them.', 'We did prayers with them. We tell them to do prayers at 1’o clock. Nobody was ready when we told them initially. Everybody used to feel like “Instead of giving half an hour in this, we can do some work for half an hour and can earn. Even if we are doing one line of embroidery and is getting only 4 rupees, it is okay for one hour”, and nobody used to sit. It took about 8 months for us to even put into their mind that “This is very important for you to improve your mental status as you are sitting quietly”. We are doing prayers, but it is just a medium. At least they would be able to sit relaxed, otherwise they are always doing this or that or chit chatting, right? They don’t sit quietly at all. So we have found this way that by using prayers as medium, at least they will sit quietly for some time, listen to good words, read and they can talk whatever is there in the mind.', 'No other medium, because here we are working only on relational bonding. Because if these people are feeling like that they are studying us or using us for their advantage, many people would have distrust because of that also. They would think like these people are earning money by knowing our stories and at many a times that is true as well. Many institutions use to earn money in the name of poor people and those poor people don’t get anything.', 'Yes, they know about it now. As we are working on that for so many years, now they know about it.', 'They will respond, but you will have to do lot of work for that.', 'Because here many fake websites are there, many fake phone calls or messages are happening, so you have to do a lot of work to build the trust.', 'I don’t see any superficial reason for that. What I feel is like, we don’t know that whether they are forgiving from their heart or not. It normally happens like if today they are fighting, then in tomorrow they will be together again. And if they are fighting again, then they would remember about the previous ones. So may be in their mind, on the level of the dignity, it may be going deep within. Suppose today if you used any bad words against me, that would go deep inside into my mind. Right ? I may not remember that in my daily life. They will connect socially again in their every day life. If they have done a fight in the morning, they will be together again in the evening. It is like that. If they are having a fight in the afternoon, then they will be together again in the evening. In two or three days, they will forget everything. But when they are fighting again, then they will remember about these old stories again. So this is only about the values know, where the work is needed to be done.', 'I told you know that here the work is done as per generation.', \"Yes, it will be the previous generation. And in that also there are certain criteria that if the people in the previous generation is not working properly or if there is any problem in the family, \\xa0then the new generation would take the charge. So the new generation will get involved and would say that ”Whatever you are saying is right, but nowadays it would not do. So our generation wants to do it in this way” \\xa0For example, the previous generation tells to produce four kids, but the present generation tells like “No,  we cannot afford four kids. Everything has become so expensive and we are not able to earn so much. Then why should we have so many children?”. So even if there is a pressure from the previous generation, our generation will tell that ”No, we don't want”. So they have only one or two children. That means even if they are having only daughters, \\xa0they would do the operation. They won't keep producing more, by expecting for a boy child. There are many people like that.\", 'The safe which is made of iron sheets, like this. Everybody has safe like this in their house and on one side there would be a mirror and that works as a dressing table.', 'Is it for the community for which we are working?', 'Yes, okay.', 'Yeah, many a times it so happens that they use to take their tiffin and go, and come back with that tiffin without getting any work.', 'This is 17th year.', 'I had started as an anganwadi teacher and worked as the anganwadi teacher for about 3 years. But at that time Manav Sadhna had 4 to 5 anganwadis. In those, like how the children are being taught in the private preschools I use to teach the children and give them nutritious food as well . And at that time we were not as partners with the government. Since 2004, the Manav Sadhna and thus anganwadi has started its partnership with the Gujarat government. So from 2004 onwards, I had been worked as an anganwadi supervisor and from 2007 onwards I had been worked as an anganwadi coordinator. So right from the beginning I am attached with the program of anganwadi. And for last 2 years I am with Manav Sadhna’s International Volunteer Programme.', 'In slum, almost everybody is migrated. Mostly people had come here by migrating from Gujarat itself. And if they had migrated from other states, then most of them had came from U.P and Rajasthan. Many people use to come from these 2 states. Maharashtrians also come, but very few. Mainly it is from U.P and Rajasthan, since Rajasthan is closer to us and from U.P the people use to go to wherever they find the work. So people use to come here in search of job. But mostly people use to come here by migrating from the villages. For example, the people over here are migrated from the villages which are closer to the rivers of Ahmedabad, like you might be knowing the places like Mehsana, Kadi, Kalol or Mansa. In this slum, there are only a very few people who is from Saurashtra or from far off places which are about 300 or 400 kilometers farther. There may not be many people like that. They are very few. I am telling this as per my knowledge. So mainly people over here have come from the villages of Gujarat, Rajasthan and U.P.', 'Yes, it is good. There is a foundation that is needed for the family. You can see that where there are children, parents have to go out for work like if father is a mason, then he have to go out in the morning itself and mother may also go out to pick papers or to work at somebody’s place as a household maid. Then she also have to go out in the morning. Then who would take care of their children? Then children would be roaming around. But if in laws like grandmother, grandfather or any other are there, then they would take care of the children. They would make sure that the children would not be roaming around and there would be some differences in their values and culture as well.', 'Yes, and I feel that because of that only it is been sustaining like this. I am not seeing it in anywhere else, but it is not like the very dangerous slums like in somewhere else. This Tekro is not a that much dangerous slum. And obviously this difference is made by the grandparents. It must have made the difference means that the situation is still balanced. That is what I feel. I believe in this way because where there are nuclear family couples, they have to struggle with things like bringing kids to anganwadi, to keep them clean or to take care of their health as the child is alone and keeps roaming around. When the poor mother comes in the afternoon, she would cook something and feed the child. They would not be even knowing that where is the child, or whether he is wearing dirty clothes or he is hungry. If we want to bring the child to anganwadi, then the ladies who are working here as helpers have to go there, give bath to their child and would bring them here. But if grandparents are there, then at least they would take a little bit of care and so that when the anganwadi finishes, then the child would go back home and would not roam around in heavy sun. They would take that much care. If they are having a little bit of knowledge about nutrition, then if the child is falling sick or something, then they would take care for the child. And where there is only parents and their children, the child is not taken care.', 'We are working for the children who are up to six years old. In that case there is not coming such a situation and they are not capable to understand that why they should not go out in sun or why they should not eat certain things. So we try to make them understand the things in a funnier way. Suppose they had pepsi, then we tell them that “See, you had got cold know. You are having that pepsi, right ? That is why it is happening. See you fall sick and got fever know. You ate this thing, right? So this had happened”. But our work is mainly with the child’s parents. We do this work of awareness with their parents. Children don’t understand these things. The child’s intelligence has not yet developed enough to understand what is right and what is wrong for them. We explain to their parents that “Why you are not hindering them from eating those Pepsi, Kurkure or that two rupees packet Paplu. As there is no nutrition in that, your money is getting wasted and your child’s health is getting spoiled. Then you will have to pay money to the doctor as well, because when the child eat things like Pepsi or other fried items, his health will get spoiled. Rather you send them to anganwadi, then your child will be taken care of , will get nutritious food, would sit here nicely for 3 or 4 hours and would learn something . ”', 'Yes. In the anganwadi, the children are of age 0 to 6 years. They are our beneficiaries. So we do the work of awareness with the elder people.', 'The neighbors would be knowing. Whether these people are telling them or not, they would definitely knowing that what is going on in a family. Secondly, those who are in contact with them on a daily basis, somebody like Anganwadi teachers or Anganwadi assistant teachers, they know about it. Also there are lane workers of the government, they use to know about it. If ladies are having a problem like husband is beating or mother-in-law is troubling, then they might go and tell to their friend in the neighborhood or to any lady from the village as they are from the same village. So they would share with her that such things are going on. Also they use to share with the Anganwadi ladies.', 'We are working on that as well. In Anganwadi we are working with the mothers of the young girls. You won’t believe that in slums there are causing unexpected pregnancies in young girls as they are getting abused by a family member who are closer to their family, by young boys or elderly men from the community. And their knowledge about the reproductive health is very limited. And also there are many incidents happening in the community that the girls of hardly 17 years old use to run away with somebody.', 'Yes, \\xa0because they feel like this is love and this person might be there for whole life. So she runs away and then the boy leaves her after a month. Then she has to come back home. Most of the times she might be pregnant. So we are working with their mothers to tell them “What kind of relationship should you share with your daughter?”, ”Why don’t you send them to school?”. So we enquire them that \\xa0”Why are you beating them” or ”Why don’t you trust her?”. We used to talk to their mothers,  since when their daughters reach to 7th or 8th class they use to leave their education and when we ask why, they would say like “Now she had become young and as she goes out she would meet some boy and might fall in love and runs away. You know that these things are happening ”. Then we use to tell them that “They are falling in love not because of that they are going out. Why your daughter is not sharing things with you?”. Also we make them understand that this age is like that. The adolescents is such an age….', 'Yes, \\xa0since there are a lot of changes happening and they will be having lot of questions. They may not be able to tell or cannot even bear it. So your relationship with your daughter should be in such a way that she should be able to tell you everything. If you give her love, if you give her respect or if you make her study, then she would be able to understand. And because of that understanding she would think before taking any wrong steps. So we are working with the girls and also with their mothers. We use to explain to them that “What kind of relationship should you share with your daughter ? What your children need? \\xa0They want love. How they would feel if you are beating them or pressurizing them?”. When mother beats her child I would always tell the mother that “Right now you are the role model your child and you are beating her. You are beating and so he would only see that and would think like my mother used to do like that, so I can also do like that or that is the right thing. Then tomorrow he also starts to beat you. Today you have beaten him and tomorrow he is going to beat you. Or if sometimes some incidents are occurring, then he would not even think before beating you or his wife, because you are doing that right now. So you are giving him that”. There is a saying know “Whatever is there in the well, \\xa0will only come to the pool” . So if you are giving them love, nice environment and good values, then it will open up in him. But if you are giving a negative  environment for your child or if you are putting a wrong example by your own behavior that “no need to give love for your child and behave as if  he is your property”, then children also will behave in the same way to you when they grow up.', \"Unfortunately I don't know much about boys. There are some boys who come to Manav Sadhna, then they might be talking to their teachers. But I don't know much about that. Unfortunately I don't know much about boys, because we are working with girls. We are closer to girls.\", \"I don't know much about boys, because I have not worked with boys. But for girls, \\xa0first of all they cannot tell anything to anybody. So they are confused as to where they should go. At the most she would have a friend to whom she can talk to and she also may not be knowing much about things like why this is happening or what should I do for a particular thing. First of all they have not even got education, also there is not such an atmosphere in their house where there is a person who can give right advice to them. So there is nobody in their surroundings. Till there was not Anganwadi and we have started doing the programs for girls, it was like that. But now there is Anganwadi and our program for girls, so at least the girls try to reach the ladies of the Anganwadi and talk to them.\", 'Teachers are there. Anganwadi sisters are there. And the people those who are not going to school, like doing some work and has left the school or those who has not joined any institutions like Manav Sadhna and are not going to school, so for them their friend or whomsoever is there, is the place where they share their problems or express themselves. And the friends are also mostly the same.', 'That kind of thing might be there in boys.', 'In girls, it is like that they may say “no”, because among girls, her friend might not be having that kind of a situation from which she can put her foot forward and help the other. So even if she wanted to do, she can’t do anything because she has her own limitations. But such things might be there in boys. It is there always. For example, when the kitchen of Anganwadi from Manav Sadhna was going on, the community boys used to work with us. They were all friends of each other. They all help each other in wrongful deeds.', 'Yes, definitely. For those who have more children, when the government or people from government or anganwadi or other good people tell them to do good things, they don’t want to listen at any time and don’t want to follow it in their lives. And there is always improvement in the lives of those who understands a little bit or those who have less children or those who are connecting these awareness work about what is going on in this world. You can immediately see those differences in their lives.', 'We are working with 79 communities through 79 anganwadis. Then in that I can say 30 communities would be like that, where we tell them and they will listen, they will come in meetings and they have less children as well. I can show you that kind of communities. It is completely different and after telling once or twice the work is done in those community. And those who are not listening at all, where we have lot of struggle, they don’t want to listen at any cost and there the work is done by even after telling 25 times. For example, if we go from here then Chandrabhaga Mokhado comes. So there, we have to struggle the most. Then there is one more area which is ours, that is Sabarmathi, where we have 33 anganwadis. There are also many areas where we have to struggle. Just opposite to that, there are good areas as well, like Chaul of MPs. If you see there, they have less children and parents are little bit educated. They are ready to listen to whatever anganwadi teachers say. They comes regularly in the meetings , would listen whatever we says , take care for if we have told them anything for children , come for vaccination, do deliveries  in hospital and use to send children regularly for studying. So if you see their lives it is completely different.', 'They take. But compared to boys, girls take more advantage. Boys also take advantage, but I don’t know why. But I feel that these skill development schemes of government lack something due to which the boys take the training but they don’t get the work .May be that provision is not proper, because there have been so many examples in which it has happened that after taking training under these skill development schemes they don’t get the work due to some reason or maybe they themselves have not tried much. So they don’t get job and they would say that this training does not help in any way. And for the girls as well, even though they participate the most in the skill development programs, they don’t do anything afterwards. They would say that they did beauty parlor course, or they have learned to make bags. They say like that but what next? Government keeps telling that they will give the material and you just make and if you make nicely, we will create the marketing facilities. But you have to keep patience in everything as it takes time. But for whatever reason these people don’t have that patience. They have set this concept in the mind that I have taken training under skill development, so from tomorrow onwards I should start earning 2000 rupees. And this mentality is there in girls as well as boys. Many times, I had felt like for boys this skill development programs needs to be redesigned, where they are also told and taught that it is not only about developing skills. They need to be told as how to do work after that on your own. For example, suppose a person learns plumbing. If you see nowadays there is so much of demand for plumbing. If you see in my house also, there is a plumbing work to be done, but we are waiting for 15 days .But we don’t get plumber as there is so much demand for them and if you see around, plumbers are earning around 700 rupees per day. Do you know that? For plumber it is 700 rupees per day.', 'Yes, it is 700 rupees per day. So for them, they can get a lot in less hard work.', 'Yes, right. So, they learn plumbing, but after that they have to learn to make some connections, contacts and you have to develop trust as well. If you create connection, then here in Manav Sadhna itself, plumber is required in every day. There are so many institutions of ours itself. There we don’t have even one official plumber. So you can think about, for the boys who have learned with us how much work we can give to them. But they don’t have patience or sometimes they don’t have commitments towards work. So, these things also should be taught in skill development program.', 'Asking for work! See first of all I will tell you the truth. There are few boys or girls who would go to people on their own. I am telling you that when a person comes twice or thrice to Manav Sadhna, then they might work for free of cost also ,may be only twice .Then in the case of electricians, there is a lady who comes to anganwadi, her husband is an electrician, so if I have any small work, then I would call him immediately . Your efficiency and commitments also count to that. Like if I call you today at 10’o clock, then you should come at 10 ‘clock. Like if I use to come after two hours and make people wait like that or everybody sitting and waiting for you, then? So, there is lack of such seriousness in boys.', 'You should know how to make connections. You will get work with help of connections. Then the character, honesty, it’s like all together.', 'They are very few.  I am telling you know, there are very few who would come and ask for work.', 'I feel they are not able to make connections because if they have made connection, for example, I know the ladies of my anganwadi. If husband of anyone of them is doing plumbing work, then I would know about it and if call him once or twice and I feel that this person is doing good job, then I would tell about him to five other people that you must call him. So like that work can be carried on.', 'There will be mouth publicity. Like if comes on time and he does work properly then I feel that he is honest. He may also charge the money reasonably, then I would tell about him to some other person also. Everybody needs know. He or the other says, “I want carpenter. Please get my work done”. I know as I am here at this place. People keep asking me that “I want this, I want that”.  Volunteers keep asking me that where to give laundry. Then I can tell others, I can tell ten people like “Do you want electrician? Please call this person”. But when will I say? When their work is efficient and they have to keep connection with me. I may forget. But see there is an electrician who keep asking me that, “Sister, is there any work there? Let me know if it is there”. So, he doesn’t give me a chance to forget. So, these things should be there in boys. But somewhere that is missing.', 'Yes, and little bit of patience should be there, that I would get work. Let it start at least, like once the train is on the track, then it is definitely going to run. But there is a starting problem. Many a times what happens is that, see in these boys or people of Tekra, there is the issue of commitment. If there is some marriage or somebody’s death, then they would go away for 15 days. They go to village. They will not even call and inform. The communication is also very poor from their side. Communication is so poor, that suppose if I say that, “See I called you today at 10’o clock”. Then he would say that, see in my house this is what happened, or I would have guests in my house, so I could not go out. It is okay, but you have to at least call and inform. So then because of such problems, the feeling is that these people are like this only and so we don’t want to call anybody from Tekra. These people have this kind of issues. Every time some social thing would be going on. Somebody dies or some marriage would be there, so they go away for 10 to 15 days. Like we have one Kaushik Bhai. We took him recently in our health area. He came and after 15 days he asked for leave saying that “I have to go to village for 10 days, because there is a marriage”. So, he went for 10 days to his village. So these things happen and I suspect that how it is going to work. If just now you have come and you take 10 days leave for marriage, then how the work will be done? In my house some plumbing work is pending, then electrician did half of the work, for rest half he said I will not come for ten days. Then how will I recommend that you call this person.', 'Yes, there has to be commitment. Commitment and efficiency, both are needed. And honesty as well, that whatever money you are charging has to be reasonable as per prevailing rates. Suppose if somebody’s work is very good and when they are charging too much, then also I can’t recommend.', 'First of all, I feel that they would not be having any idea that if we are taking this type of approach, then we would get work. Also, secondly it is because of “Laghuta granthi”(inferiority complex). What is the other word for that…?', '“Laghuta granthi” means they discourage themselves. For example, they think like “I am from Tekra, and therefore will I get work over here or no”.', 'Yes, they don’t have that confidence, whether people will give them work or not. Or if I go there will they even allow me to stand there. So, like that they don’t have the communication skill or the confidence to express themselves.', 'Yes, lack of information is also there. They don’t have the knowledge of these things that we can also do these kinds of things and these people can help them to get work also or if they had done some production then for marketing, people are available. They don’t know these things.', 'Manav Sadhna is working with them from last 25 years. See, among them Manav Sadhna has connection with the community. Whereas the government people don’t have that kind of connection. Then how will they trust?', 'General jobs, mostly everybody is on daily wages and labor works. In that there are doing mason workers, autorickshaw drivers and also there are some people, which I feel around 10% of people, might be doing government job as well.', 'Yes, they work in Torrent.', 'As an electrician or they work in government as peon or as a cleaning labor, also doing delivery of gas cylinders. Lot of young boys go for doing delivery of the cylinders because you get more money in that and in that you can cheat also, like emptying half of gas cylinders and then…Such things do happen. So young boys mostly go in that way, because they get more money per day, even by doing faulty deeds.', 'Yes, in a marriage, to serve people or to cut the vegetables. They go for doing these kinds of works.', 'No, for the masonry work, it is 700 rupees per day.', 'Not like that. I am saying about those who are going for the labor work.', 'And for those who are going for the masonry work earn around 10,000 rupees per month. And those who are on daily wages get around 6000 or so. And the ladies who are speaking papers from the garbage,\\xa0earn around 3000 rupees per month. 3000 or 4000. They would earn 3000 for sure. The ladies who are going as housemaids also earn around 2500 to 3000 rupees. Rickshaw drivers earn around 8000 to 10000 rupees', 'Those are one of the communities in Vaghri and they do the work of selling vegetables and all.', \"Yes, even if they get, I won't say that everybody don't have discipline. But on an average to a lot of extent, that commitment or sincerity is missing, like if today I have got a work, so what should I do to keep getting work in future as well. For that we need to make connections, should be sincere and should reach on time if there is a commitment on time. If you are doing that much, then who will not give you work? People are looking for somebody who would do work.\", 'Yes, I don’t \\xa0feel that there is lack of opportunities. Where I am staying, \\xa0everyday some or the other call use to come, asking like “ we need a plumber”,” we need a carpenter”,”we need like this” and all. Right now we don’t have a proper builder as well. We have constructed so many buildings and still we are looking for a builder. So it is like that.', \"Yes, spicy means they have to eat spicy. In so much of heat as well, \\xa0they eat so much spicy food that when I am trying to eat that food I may feel giddy. They eat that much spicy food. How much ever monetary problem they are having, \\xa0irrespective of that they want to eat it by putting so much of oil. They put too much of oil in things like Bhakri or fried things. They will definitely eat like that and for that they would do how much ever hard work they need to do, even if they are having some problems or are suffering. Also they face lot of problems because of that like stomach problems or piles. But they don't compromise on their food habits.\", 'No. Almost everybody here is working, know. Though they are having too much of oil, they are working as well. They work physically quite a lot. The main problem in the gents is addictions like tobacco or alcohol. Mostly it is because of these addictions they are becoming sick or are dying. If the gents are having some problem, then it is because of these addictions like Beedi, tobacco, Gutkha and alcohol. Majority of them die because of that and they have problems because of that. Cholesterol and diabetes cases are prevailing very less, to the minimal level.', 'It is only because of the thing that they have eaten like that right from the beginning. So they have got that habit.', 'For the tea it is like, even if they don’t have food it is okay for them. But they need the tea mandatorily. Their attitude is such that, whether we live or die, they need tea for sure. They have this attitude. They don’t care about the thing that they might not be able to live long or not. They know that “We would die at an early age, if we are drinking alcohol”. But they are not able to leave that. In a way their will power is very strong, but not in this matter. In a way their will power is very strong, because right from the morning they use to stand in the que for water, they use to do a lot of hard work.', 'He is an example in front of us that he use to drink a lot of alcohol and we had send him to the rehabilitation center through Manav Sadhna. Then he had left alcohol. So today his life has completely changed. That was one inspiration for us that he had decided and he is able to do like that. The will power of Mahesh Bhai is strong as well and he is doing so much of work single handedly. He has used his will power to leave his addiction. So he is doing good.', 'Their work is their exercise, they are doing so much of labor work that they don’t need to the exercises.', 'No, they don’t do anything.', 'See, the thing is like first of all I cannot talk about exercises in front of the ladies just like that. When can I talk to them? Suppose if I am starting with my anganwadi ladies, like when we are doing their workshops for the 2 to 3 days very nicely, we use to give talks and explain to them. At last we say them that “After 2 to 3 days you feel know that how much important it is to do exercise, Pranayam or Yoga. Our life will be longer. We will be happy in our lives”. Like these we explain to them everything. So like that first we have to motivate them. I cannot call them and tell them in a meeting that “Okay, from tomorrow you should start doing exercise and Yoga”. We cannot do that. Also if we are thinking deeper, right now we have to work for their basic health and hygiene and this concept of doing exercise is not there in their mind right now. So if we are talking about the concept which is not there in their mind at all, there won’t be any positive changes. So I don’t even tell them. I definitely use to tell our teachers that “You should do exercise or you should do Yoga”.', 'No, they had said like they had done these kind of lot of work for this. But Neeta Ben, I didn’t help them.', 'Mostly we can talk only know. We keep explaining to them again and again. Some times these people might blackmail them emotionally too. Suppose if a lady is having 4 to 5 kids then we tell her that “You are already having 4 to 5 kids and if you are not doing the family planning operation, when you are dying, gents will get another lady to live with. Then what will happen to your children?”. So they use to explain to them like this. So we have to work on the emotional aspect as well. We also give them motivation.', 'That depends. I feel that it depends on what type of work the camp people are doing. If they are doing good work, then everybody will come.', 'If we are going and calling them, then they will come. We have to go and call them or have to remind them that “Tomorrow there is the camp”, then they will come. We have to go and meet up on the previous day to say that “Tomorrow there is the camp and you need to be present there”, then they will come.', 'In that as well it depends on how is your connection with the community. That makes the difference. Many times I had seen like even if a sister is going to tell them for 10 times, they won’t come. Also it may happen like even you are going to tell them only once, they would come. It depends on your connection with the community or how much is your respect in the community. Many times it has happened like even if the sister is going there only once, everybody use to come. Also many times even if the other sister is going 10 times, they will not come. So it depends on how is the performance of that sister in the community. It depends completely on that.', 'See, all the communities are not same. You have to work hard and make place in their heart. You have to create trust and respect for yourself in their heart and it takes time.', 'No, but then what happens is that the ladies use to have trust on anganwadi. They are connected and they have relationship. Then they come on their own and use to share with us. They use to meet us on the road, while coming or going. Even if they are not our beneficiaries they use to talk to us like “This is what happened” and all. Suppose if some lady or an old man are staying alone or somebody is having TB and their financial condition is not good, then these sisters would give them nutrition as well, even if they are not our beneficiaries. If somebody is knowing about such things, then they would come and suggest to the sisters that “Sister, the condition of that person is not good, please take care of them. Please give him something“. So you can think this way that anganwadi is a hub for the community, since these people are working here for so many years, they know that for what all things they can approach anganwadi or what they can tell in anganwadi.', 'Yes, they have connection. Suppose you want to introduce a new subject, then you have to bring in a new concept and a new time. You have to bring in all those things. But whatever work we are doing right now, is not having nothing like that. Like we have to tell them for 500 times. If there is a meeting they will come. Isn’t it? (asking to other teachers)', 'Yes, if there is a meeting they will come.', 'For Anemia? It is because of their eating habits. Mainly it is because of their eating habits, also because of their culture like they would give foods first to gents or boys. Also they have concepts that girls don’t need to have a fat body as they are not going out for works. They don’t need to be fat or like that.', 'They use it for right type of work as well.', 'If you give something to do sitting at home….', 'Yes, if you give them work, then they may agree. You have to give them work.', \"No, they always want straight forward and short term advantage. They don't understand the long term benefits.

If you are telling them that with this your health will be good and because of that your money will be saved, then they would say that you don't talk big things. And would ask you that are you giving money, are you giving cash or are you giving work. For them it is only about that.\", 'And you will see a lot of people over there and would feel that won’t this people don’t have any work at home. The entire crowd is gathered over there only.

Still some are left from that. We used to do awareness for malaria, going to people’s house before and say what are the things to be done as precautionary measures. As precautionary measure we use to give them medicines for malaria in advance, on weekly basis. Our workers used to go door to door. Now malaria is not there at all.', 'We check. We get it checked in laboratory as well. In laboratory also, they have to pay only 50 percent, because remaining 50 percent is helped by Manav Sadhna. So, the test for diabetes cost only 50 rupees. So, if you do a test for diabetes, then you only have to pay 50 percent and the rest 50 percent of the money is helped by Manav Sadhna. So, their work is done in half the money and therefore they do it regularly.', 'Yes.', 'It may not be working for 100 percent, but 80 percent of it is done for sure.', 'Yes. This means that they don’t have to take insulin. Their work is done by taking medicines.', 'There is no reason for getting diabetes. It depends on the type of body and the nature of the body. It is not like that the person who does a lot of work will not get diabetes or the one who sits ideally will get diabetes. It is not like that. The one who pulls cart, he also gets diabetes.', 'But after explaining to him, he will become okay.', 'Their whole day work is like an exercise by itself. So they are not going to find extra time for exercising.

I would avoid him. I won’t explain to him and there is no need in wasting time in that. This is from my 20 years of experience.', 'There will be no difference and I am 100 percent sure that he will drink alcohol. So there is no need to waste time.

That is also necessary.', 'Yes, because when the treatment is written then doctor knows. He writes mostly two or three products. Like this one for the economy class, this one is for the middle class and this one is for the higher class. In the diabetes, in the blood pressure and in everything. It is like that. In that whichever medicines are selected they are highly prescribed. Because he knows that brand also. He knows through the brand name. Like for example, if they say a product for diabetes then it can be like Glenium 1 which is priced at par and is not very economical. I mean it’s of medium price, so we can write it to a normal person. But when a poor person comes Glimsium S1 or Unison, such products can be written. So, accordingly we can get such products. There they might be using the local medicines. They don’t prescribe medicines there.', 'Yes, both are working at the same time.\\xa0 Both are wireless, it can be operated from both the sides.', \"Update is done at the reception.

So, he gets his product added. If there are any new molecules as well, he will get it added. Generally, that boy who sits in the reception can add all routine medicines. Like Ornidazole, Flexisel, they all are\\xa0old models. Suppose in that, if somebody brings any new brand from the company, then I don't have any work in that. I am not needed.

It is there in the software, but at those places where there are less patients, like 10 or 20 patients, can keep that. We don’t have too much of staffs. There is less man power and there is too much work. If we try to store each and every person’s report, we don’t have that much time. Therefore, we don’t store. If there is something important to be noted, like if the patient is having hepatitis and if his acibity is 500, then we will just note down in the complaint box that his acibity is 500. Then when he comes next time with the one with 300, even though we are forgetting about the previous test, from this system we will get the information that last time it was 500 and with our medicine this much improvement has happened. So it is reduced by 200. So that is good.', 'In our software?', 'No, in this software everything is selected properly. Even we have removed a few things which we do not need practically. There is one more for education which is there in this. But right now, it is not working. There is some error in that. But in my old software it was there. Sometimes there will be some patients to whom we need to explain things like what the actual problem and all is. Suppose when we tell the patient that there is swelling in the lungs or veins, then we have to explain the patient that where the swelling actually is. So here there is a picture of lungs and here it looks like branches of tree. So, we have to explain them that, on these branches, the swelling will come at this area. (Jaldeep explains this by showing it in the computer). So, these are allergic bronchitis, and these are bronchioles. And these are borders where the swelling has come. So, when we explain such things to the patients, then patient will get an idea about what has happened to him. Patient doesn’t need to do anything after understanding it. We have to do that part. But the patient will feel mentally satisfied by thinking that the doctor has explained about it to me and the sickness is not that serious. So, he will be relaxed.', 'If we tell them that you have the problem of breathing, then they think that they have asthma and asthma remains lifelong. But mostly the patients use to have the allergic bronchitis which is a seasonal sickness. So, it may remain there for around one month. Mostly it happens during winter or during the time of season change. When there are causing special changes in the environment, it happens. Then when he has cough at that time, then we can explain it to him that the allergens from out has gone inside and because of that there is a swelling here inside. And the patients won’t take that medicine which is a device with a spray that needs to be inhaled from outside. They think that it is a device for rich people and not for the poor people. They don’t realize that this is the safest way of medication. Steroid inhalation is not much harmful. The local medicine which we gulp more are harmful. We can explain to them that if you take the capsule through that device, then that powder will directly go to these areas. So, it will have prominent effect, as it will reach to the needed place and do its work. So, we can explain like this to them.', 'For this there are not any other specific such features. Those features are the ones which you use regularly. I have downloaded this particular software called BodyWorks, because right now mine is not working, right? That’s why. All these things are there inside that software as well, in the education part. Also, in this the complete history can be saved. Like suppose if we had given medicine today, and many times patients use to come without taking their file and may tell that “Sir, the medicine that you had given me in 2001 has helped me to improve a lot. The medicine that you prescribed me for the last time doesn’t helped me to improve that much”. Some patients use to say like that. Then if we see his data till now, we will get an idea about which medicine was written for him in 2001 and which one in 2012. And with that we will get an idea that which medicine caused for faster improvement. Then we would prescribe those type of medicine. Both may be allergic medicines. But there might be difference in molecules. The molecules in one medicine might be reacting to that person in a good way, while the molecules in other medicine might not be very effective for that person.  Sometimes some medicine is such that if somebody gets sedation, he keeps sleeping too much. Then about that also they use to tell, like “I was feeling very sleepy because of the medicine that you wrote me last time. Please don’t give me that type of medicine”. Therefore, we get complete data from this software.', 'We will definitely get patients because of our credit and the work done by us.

Also have to give them knowledge about their age that, “Now this is your age and your organs may not work as intact as before, so have to take diet in this way”.

Or else some new centers have to be created, where according to the age and the disease, they would give you the explanation about the food habits, that “You have to take diet only in this particular way” or “You will become good, only when you take this particular diet”. So such things should be done. If such centers are opened, then it will make a lot of difference.', 'One is hereditary, that means it may be got from the previous generation.

Mostly 60 or 70 percent people are like that. Just doing office work or any other sitting job, their life will be stressful. We have seen more of those people. In remaining 30 percent, they might be working or may be even doing exercise. Still they get diabetes.

Those who are normal or who have a proper body with a proper weight and structure, if they walk 40 to 50 minutes five days in a week, then it is enough. Then there is no need to do more work out. But it is necessary for obese patients to join gym and do other exercises like weight lifting and all. You must do that. So that the weight reduces. Generally, for the ladies or gents, who have an average body and proper weight as per their age, walking 40 to 45 minutes is enough.', 'No, that should not be counted.

Also, those who are having routine work at home, like cleaning of the house, cleaning of vessels, in that not much is done.', 'The way is how I told you, that awareness centers need to be opened. Then only it will work. Like how gyms are opened, like that an awareness center need to be opened. Then it can be done and can make people aware about diabetes. Secondly, need to make them aware about how to take medicine, like if somebody gets vomiting, loose motion, fever and all. Suppose if somebody has got fever, then he may not be able to eat anything for two days. Then you will have to reduce the dosage of the medicine or if you are not able to eat at all, then you will have to stop the medicine. They don’t know about these things as well. They continue having medicine and get hypoglycemia. Suddenly the sugar comes down, since they are not eating anything, and the medicine is continued. They become unconscious and come here. Brain might get damaged because of that. So, such problems would happen. Many people use to come like this with hypoglycemia, as they are not aware. They don’t know how to control diabetes and what needs to be done, how to take tablets, when to stop tablets, when to start it and all. These things are also important. So, there are two sides of diabetes patients. It may increase or may get controlled, and at the same time the medicine for diabetes will be going on. But because of lack of awareness, it may reduce as well.', 'Those to whom you have explained and still coming repeatedly. Like that there are 10 percent, who are not able to follow or understand in spite of explaining to them. Such patients are 10 percent. Rest all patients are added new, since they don’t have awareness. It happens because of that. Or along with that they might be having CRF kidney diseases. In the patients whose kidneys are not working properly, it reduces as the diabetes medicine are going on, you know. It reduces frequently. So in this case also, such thing happens.', 'It is difficult to explain those things. Also, it is difficult to understand. But now even the patients have started taking those by themselves. Also, even children had started to do the work of giving insulin. They understand, and they give. So, there is no issue in taking insulin. The problem comes for those who is taking it for the first time. (A call comes for Vinod and he picks the call)', 'They only know that by eating sweet, you will get diabetes. They only know this thing. This is the only answer that they have that “Sir, we are not eating sweets. Then how we got diabetes as we are not eating sweets at all”. When we check their history, they say that “They have tea, they have cooldrinks, they are eating ice creams. But by eating that diabetes does not happen”. See, having diabetes is hereditary. A part inside our body called pancreas does not work. If a cell does not work, then by that you get diabetes. When insulin is not produced in your body, diabetes happens. Once you get diabetes, you should not eat sweets. You have to control sugar. You cannot take sugar and should have a sugar free diet. There is no problem, till the time you don’t have diabetes. Everybody has 20 percent chance of getting diabetes. Suppose if I eat and keep sitting all the time, like I keep eating sweet things and don’t burn my calories, then I have 20 percent chance of having diabetes for sure. Those who have history of hereditary, like when mother, father or grandparents are diabetic, or mother and father or brother, sister-in-law, uncle, father’s sister has diabetes, then they have 70 percent chance of having diabetes. For those whose parents have diabetes and have history of hereditary, they their children also have 70 percent chance of having diabetes.', 'Before my work was only in afternoon timings. I used to come only for TMT and PFT tests. Afterwards, since last year I made it almost full time.', 'Yes, but it is difficult, especially for middle-class. You can do that for higher class people like those who are high profiled people or highly educated people and those who are aware of these systems. It will work for them. But for others it may not be possible. (Boy is showing the application in the computer)', 'Yeah, we are getting labor charges. Yes, we get the job and we get enough money to have our food. Whether we get it or not, we have to come here every day. Sometimes, we might get someone who offer us Chutak (the work that is not based on contract) work. Then we would go to his house for doing that work. On that day we tell the contractor that we are not coming today, since we are going for Chutak work today.', 'We are not bounded by anybody.

      "['Yes , we have made arrangements to do exercises and lot of people comes to do exercises. Lot of camps are also done for different diseases.  They come to do the checkups, but not like from diagnosis to curing it. Only some people do till curing and some people treat only if we pay attention, otherwise they will leave it.', 'No, they don’t have any idea about it that those symptoms could be the reason for a disease. But we give them the information.', 'Yes, it is hereditary. My mother had it, my brother is also having it now.', 'TB is because of the thing that they drink alcohol and their lungs get destroyed. So the outside infections are caught for them very fast and their houses are very close to each other. So it is like if I have some disease today and if I sit anywhere and then those bacteria spread everywhere. And then the other person has come as drunk, his immunity will be less or he has had alcohol in empty stomach, then those people catch diseases. So because of this they catch infection very easily.', 'Yes,  they catch infectious diseases more. We see more of infectious diseases over here.', 'Yes.  We have told them that diabetes is a kind of a disease that mimic termite, like which it eats up your body from inside. So you have to take the medicines everyday and consult a doctor for check-up in every month despite your diabetes is increasing or reducing. If it becomes too low, then that is also not good. If it increases very high, then that is also not good. So now we send those people who are getting diabetes like this.', 'No. They don’t understand those things. Suppose we say if eyes or kidneys are affected, then only they come to know about this and the fact that diabetes leads to other diseases also.', 'Once the diabetes is developed, it also leads to other diseases like BP. And if the bones get infected, then we need to cut the bones as it cant be cured by medicines. If the patient get hurt by something then the wound is not healing easily, then the person might have diabetes. We give them this kind of information.', 'In this area people with diabetes is very less. But they get other diseases like TB because they eat things like Miraj and all. Also they don’t go for getting the reports. They only go to do the check up once the condition is worse. Overall diabetes is very less in this entire area.', 'Yes. If the doctor tell to cook bland, then we make like that.', 'No. They will only do like that only when the doctor confirms a disease and recommend bland food or ask to avoid particular food.', 'yes. They might leave the course. But only few people do that.', 'Yeah, \\xa0they cannot say in the house.', 'Yes, \\xa0it is a serious disease.', 'Yes, he does. When he had these kind of problem, he used to do regularly. In every 15 days he had to go to civil for doing checkups. But once he became alright and he started walking, he stopped. Now if he is getting any new disease then he will start again, otherwise he will not do anything.', \"I can tell you that so many ladies of the 60 years old haven’t gone still also, for doing checkups. Whatever it is they would not go to the dispensary. They say like if we go to the dispensary then of course some diseases will be told to us know and it will come out. Instead they will just bear it. So they don't want to do the checkups.\", \"Some people may do that. \\xa0But some people may say that we are alive and we have this habit and that we are not able to leave. Then they don't listen.\", 'Yes, \\xa0it is temporary. \\xa0Just for the sake of saying they observe those for some time only. Recently there was a patient to whom the doctor has advised to have eggs because of his disease. So doctor told him that “You must eat eggs”. But then he replied that “We cannot eat eggs because of spiritual reasons”. So doctor asked him that “If you cannot eat eggs as you are a spiritual person, then how about alcohol. Is it allowed?”', 'At that time when they are told they would listen, but after that they will not adhere to. There are very few.', 'There is one girl who had TB. She was very young of 16 or 17 years old. In first stage, her medicines are going on ,50% medication was completed and 50% was pending. She has already started to become alright because in TB when you take medication for few days, then recovery happens. When people stop taking medicines, then after sometime TB happens again with twice stronger than before. Because once recovered and if TB is coming again, then it comes in with double force. So, she got TB again and then again she started medicines. She took medicine for 15 days and again it recovered. Again she dropped the medication. Now she has got TB as a lifelong disease. Now, she has to go to take medicines every time after certain intervals. Now, she is having breathing problems. She takes less of breath due to very low pressure. Because of that she comes once or twice in a week to the dispensary. Now she has to take medicines for longer period of time.', 'Normally fever, cough cold, vomiting and loose motion.', 'Mostly all.', 'No', 'See those who came here have an idea about how and what are the thing that harms them. They have that idea. Suppose thousands of people are there in community, but out of them hardly 100 people came here. Only those 100 people will know that eating this can cause these problems or diseases. Rest of them doesn’t know because they didn’t come to camp. In general camps everyone use to come, but we cannot do all these things at that time as the time is limited.', 'yes', 'They must be having the idea.', 'If diseases are such, then only the question of cooking separate arises. For example, if the person has TB and the family members know about that, then they would cook separately for them and give. Also I have seen that \\xa0these people have never turned their back when there comes a question of taking care. It may be with their heart, with the fear of their community or by thinking it as their own duty. But they do take care.', 'If the patient is a TB patient, \\xa0then the cooking is done separately. For them doctors advises that we should emphasize on cooking separate for that person and need to keep their vessels as separate, since it is a contagious disease . Otherwise it is not like that “The person is sick, so cook separate for him”. It is cooked only if it is required.', \"That also if the doctor has suggested, then only. Otherwise they don't cook separate for the reason of not able to touch them.\", 'Whereas during this time so much of care has been taken and medicines are given right from the beginning. Still the children are born with diseases and they need to be kept in incubator. They have heart problems. So this need to researched to know what is the problem for “In spite of taking so much of care, at last this is the result” . That is why the trust on the doctors have been reduced. And you have to do cesarean means you have to put 15 to 20 thousand rupees on the table at first.', 'They may not be knowing about the last two parts, that which parts of the body are harmed by it and which are other diseases caused by that. That they don’t know. They know what causes diabetes and what happens when a person gets diabetes. They know that and whether it can be cured or not. Their knowledge is till there. They don’t know about the last two questions that you said.', 'Other people will not come to know that this person is having diabetes. Today if we both are sitting, then you would not be able to know that the opposite person is having diabetes. Same is the case with TB. See these people are scared to some extent to share about diseases. They think that if they are sharing about their disease to someone else, then that person might keep aversion from them.', 'It is diabetes that is coming under the chronic diseases. But in this community diabetes is not a big problem.', 'It is as per season.', 'In Sanjeevani, all types of patients. Paralysis patients, patients having liver disease due to alcohol, BP, diabetes.', 'There is no difference as such. Same sickness only is there.', 'Skin disease patients and asthma patients are more on Tekra. You don’t see those kinds of patients outside. These people have skin diseases or eczema, because these people don’t have much awareness on cleanliness. So, they have more of skin diseases.', 'Skin diseases they have urticaria, psoriasis, rashes…', 'That’s the main reason for their skin diseases.', 'All type of diseases are there.', 'Yes. Suppose somebody needs more, like, in case of skin diseases, he doesn’t have to consult every day. Then for them we give as for two, three, four or five days. Suppose a person has asthma, then he need not have to come every day and he has to take medicines regularly. For him we give for four or five days at a time.', 'No. It’s not there at all and before 20 years the picture of Rampir ka Tekra was very different and today it is different. Before they defecated wherever they want, there were water clogged at many places, curls would be there everywhere. Now toilets are built in everyone’s house, so that filth is not there anymore. So naturally diseases also will reduce.', 'For those who have heart diseases, the treatment is done in government hospitals. So, when they come to us we explain to them, that you have to eat less salt, don’t take much stress, and take medicines regularly and do regular checkups. Then they avoid taking the extra salt on the top. But they don’t do separate cooking for them. They eat the routine food. They keep a caution and make sure that they don’t take extra salt on top.', 'It comes into hereditary diseases, but it is not that everybody will get it hereditarily. Out of everybody only 50 percent will get. Suppose your grandfather had, so there are higher chances for you and your brother or sisters getting it as hereditary. That doesn’t mean that if you don’t take sugar now, you will not get. You may get and if your sister is not eating sugar she also might get it. And the one who is eating might not get. It can happen like that also.', 'Yes, in that there are higher chances.', 'This is a wrong way of thinking. See, because of diabetes everything is happening, and body parts are getting affected. But when the diabetes is under control then that damage will be less. But if it is not controlled, it can cause damages. But people are not understanding this. That’s why they are saying that because of diabetes these problems are happening. But if it is controlled, then the damage will only be caused after many years. This damage may occur earlier, if it is not controlled.', 'Yes.', 'With the help of that, if a person comes and if he doesn’t have diabetes, then now we can warn him to be careful of diabetes, as there are chances. Then if somebody has diabetes, then there are chances for that person to have heart disease or to have stroke. Then we can warn him for those things. Then there is his exact statuses like whether he is a smoker or not and whether he consumes alcohol or not. So, it is related with these things. So, it’s a basic system. Before there were lots of tabs in this, like for example in this you have a lot of tabs and it’s a complex system. It was a lot like that before, but Poonam Bhai sees everyone in two hours and the patient number comes around seventy. So, he cannot give more than one to one and half minutes to a patient. So we had to remove those tabs.', 'Yes, we don’t write everything. But we will write about whatever comes abnormal, just for our reference. Many a times patients also use to tell that these things are there noted in the computer. So, it is okay, if we are not taking it with us. Also, we write the specific diagnosis, that this person has these diseases and in a disease the problems and the tests that comes across are same. Only abnormal reports will be there.', 'And there are a few things which are fixed, like in the case of common diseases like diarrhea and all. So, if a patient comes with diarrhea, then the medicine for that is fixed and we just have to select it during diagnosis. From here you can select the diagnosis, so directly the medicine is prescribed.', 'Another thing in this software is that the patient’s photo can also be saved. So, if you can take a picture of a patient, then that also can be done. You may not be remembering a patient by his name. Now, when the patient comes, we know that this is the name of this person. But if we want to talk about him later that “This person had this type of disease and we did these things for him”, then we may not be remembering whether his name was Poonam Bhai or something else. But when you see the picture, like this person is Raman Bhai and this is his picture. (Show on screen) Everybody will not remember names. But in this the photograph comes. I were doing like this in between, but now again I had stopped that, because now our staff has changed. See here the photograph used to come. Whom so ever patients’ name has been given, immediately his photograph will come. When we register his name for the first time, we click his picture as well.', 'Yes, diabetes.', 'We mostly get those patients with loose motion, vomiting, dengue and malaria. Either they will be having fever or might have vomiting and loose motion. Also, patients use to come with breathing problem, which is known as COPD. They are the patients with lung diseases. In that smokers also use to come with breathing problem. And those who have breathing problem with fever are mostly TB patients. So, they come with infection, with TB and breathing problem. So, all these comes in lungs problems. We also use to see pneumonia patients, also patients who come with cardiac attack, patients with myocardial infarction. Also, patients with cerebral CV stroke, whose blood would be clotted in brain or with hemorrhage, come. So, such unconscious patients also come. Patients who are paralyzed also come. They might be having paralysis on one arm and one leg and will be unconscious. They come like that. So, these kinds of patients come routinely. Also, here use to come a hematologist and oncologist. So, their patients also get admitted here, especially for cancer. In that, ladies with breast cancer and ovarian cancer use to come. Gents use to come with the cancer of vocal mucosa, liver cancer, lung cancer and throat cancer.', 'The very first reason is because of food habit. They eat and drink from outside. Also, they are unhygienic. There is a community acquired pneumonia and in that there are people who are immuno-compromised. Those who have HBsAG, HIV or HC infections, are immune-compromised right from the beginning. They get these infections immediately. So, pneumonia happens also because of weather and so they get infections from each other. The swine flu which is going on right now, in that in a very shorter period like 3 or 4 days itself, pneumonia happens. In such cases community acquired cross infection occurs.', 'Most of the problems are caused because of food habits. Those who are suffering from stomach diseases, like jaundice, loose motion and vomiting, typhoid, are caused because of food habits.', 'It is not necessary that all the patients who have disease can be fat or obese. It is not like that. Some might have an average body. Some might be thin, and some are obese as well.', 'From here they use to listen to whatever instructions we give. We tell them that you should do these and these things. But such patients always fail and because of that only, these things are happening. Their food habit is bad at home, as they don’t keep curtailments. Only for those people, it becomes uncontrolled in this way. Hardly for one percent it might happen because of some other mistake. For those who don’t take proper medicine and don’t have proper eating habits, the disease goes uncontrolled.', 'Along with medicine, we have to give them knowledge about the disease, about their food habits. Also have to give them knowledge about their age that, “Now this is your age and your organs may not work as intact as before, so have to take diet in this way”. So like this we can make that person aware about that. Or else some new centers have to be created, where according to the age and the disease, they would give you the explanation about the food habits, that “You have to take diet only in this particular way” or “You will become good, only when you take this particular diet”. So such things should be done. If such centers are opened, then it will make a lot of difference.', 'Apart from diabetes, BP problem is more. Heart problem is also more. Diabetes is more. Breathing problem is also more. Breathing problem is there because of problem with lungs or heart. These are seen more because of the habit of smoking. So, these four are there for sure. Diabetes, BP, heart problem and breathing problem. Apart from diabetes, mostly these are seen.', 'Those to whom you have explained and still coming repeatedly. Like that there are 10 percent, who are not able to follow or understand in spite of explaining to them. Such patients are 10 percent. Rest all patients are added new, since they don’t have awareness. It happens because of that. Or along with that they might be having CRF kidney diseases. In the patients whose kidneys are not working properly, it reduces as the diabetes medicine are going on, you know. It reduces frequently. So in this case also, such thing happens.', '25 percent are insulin patients. There are 25 to 30 patients, who are elderly people with chronic disease.', 'I mean diabetes and heart diseases are related.', 'Those who have diabetes, can have the problem of stroke. He can have heart disease, kidney problems. There are chances for having all the three for that person.', 'In this your entire history comes, then these diseases are there, family history and habit also comes, and which medicine give reactions or which medicine you are not supposed to take can be added. So, you can add those allergic details.', 'They have their manual file and other details like, for example, what medicine give them reaction, what diseases are there or what are their habits are fed once.', 'No, we just know about diabetes.']\n"
